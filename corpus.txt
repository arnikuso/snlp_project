<01> Keir Starmer is a husband, father, and former Chief Prosecutor. His entire career has been about securing justice for those that need it.
<01> From representing people on death row as a human rights lawyer, to working on setting up the Northern Ireland Police Board in the wake of the Good Friday agreement, to making the law work for victims as Chief Prosecutor.
<01> He was elected leader of the Labour Party in 2020 to continue this work.
<01> Childhood
<01> Keir grew up in a small town called Oxted, in Surrey. His dad worked as a toolmaker in a factory and his mum was a nurse for the NHS.
<01> Like many families, they faced challenges. His mum battled a rare, severe illness for all her life. Keir spent lots of his childhood seeing his mum go into hospital, where his father would always be at her side.
<01> Despite the challenges this presented for Keir, he was hugely influenced by his mother’s courage and determination to live her life despite her illness. It also gave him a deep gratitude for the NHS.
<01> At school he worked hard to sit the 11-plus and passed, then going to a local grammar school. When he was 18 years old, he got a place at Leeds University to study law, becoming the first in his family to go to university.
<01> Keir was obsessed with football and still plays every Sunday with friends. He describes himself as a “box-to-box midfield general,” although his teammates may have different views. A lifelong Arsenal fan, he has a season ticket at the Emirates, where he attends with his children.
<01> Standing up for working people
<01> Keir got his qualifications as a lawyer in 1987 and began working as a barrister.
<01> He spent a lot of his time providing free legal advice defending ordinary people against the powerful. He worked on some high-profile cases, taking on fights against the odds with Shell and McDonalds, as well as working with the National Union of Mineworkers to prevent the Tories’ pit closures.
<01> After that, Keir was the legal advisor to the Northern Ireland Policing Board for five years. The board was an important part of bringing communities together following the Good Friday Agreement.
<01> It was during this time when Keir first met his wife, Victoria, who now works for the NHS.
<01> Keir and Victoria married in 2007. The couple have two children.
<01> In 2008, Keir became Director of Public Prosecutions, putting him at the head of the Crown Prosecution Service and its thousands of employees. During that time there were big cuts to public services, and Keir had to reform the service to make sure it still delivered the justice people rightly expect of the system.
<01> As well as changing the way the CPS worked, he was involved in seeing through some important cases, that had a big impact on society to this day. He helped bring Stephen Lawrence’s murderers to justice, changed the guidance to better support for victims of sexual and domestic violence, and prosecuted MPs for misuse of expenses.
<01> Keir received a knighthood in 2014 for his services to criminal justice. He proudly invited his parents to Buckingham Palace for the event, who in turn brought along the family dog!
<01> Later in life, Keir’s drive to make the world a fairer place saw him enter politics. He was first elected to Parliament in 2015, at the age of 52. He serves as the member for Holborn and St Pancras, where he has lived for many years with his family.
<01> He was Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (2016-2020) and Shadow Immigration Minister (2015-2016).
<01> In April 2020, Keir was elected as Leader of the Labour Party.
<01> “It is the honour and privilege of my life. I will do my utmost to guide us through these difficult times, to serve all our communities, and to strive for the good of our country.”
<01> Keir Starmer
<01> Getting Britain’s future back, together
<01> Right now, it feels like Britain isn’t working.
<01> Our public services are on their knees, hard working people are not making ends meet, victims of crime are being let down, and that deep British belief, that the next generation will be better off, is at risk.
<01> Keir Starmer and the Labour Party offer the change our country needs. Not just reassurance that it will be ok, but hope. There is a better future for Britain.
<01> Labour will build a Britain that is forging ahead, not falling behind. One where the economy is secure, and rewards hard work. One where you don’t have to move away to get on. If you want to help us build a better country for working people, join us
<01> Rachel Reeves speech to business leaders at Rolls Royce
<01> May 28, 2024
<01> Good morning.
<01> In five weeks’ time, the British people will go to the polls.
<01> To make a profound choice about the future of our country.
<01> And where better to think about the future than here at Rolls Royce, in Derby.
<01> Away from the short-termism of politics, the pessimism of our present moment, here you have the very model of a great British business…
<01> … a global brand synonymous with excellence…
<01> … that continues to this day to pioneer in new technologies critical to the challenges of a changing world…
<01> … from submarine technologies crucial to defence, to the development of carbon neutral aviation at the frontier of the climate transition.
<01> And a business partnering with homegrown small and medium enterprises throughout its supply chain…
<01> … which has nurtured deep roots in this city going back more than a century.
<01> A business built on the foundations of a past in which we can take pride, with a vision of a future that we can invest our hope in.
<01> **
<01> As Shadow Chancellor, one of the great privileges of this role has been to travel the country and meet entrepreneurs, innovators and business leaders all across the UK.
<01> In the most challenging of economic times, they give me immense optimism.
<01> Today I want to put forward a simple proposition:
<01> That this changed Labour Party is today the natural party of British business.
<01> And I want to set out the central economic fault line in this election, the choice before the British people on the fourth of July:
<01> Five more years of chaos with the Conservative Party, leaving working people worse off;
<01> Or stability with a changed Labour Party.
<01> TORY INSTABILITY
<01> I can tell you exactly what Rishi Sunak wants you to think on polling day.
<01> He’s already saying it.
<01> That the plan is working – don’t change course now.
<01> That the chaos and instability wrought by Liz Truss was just a blip.
<01> That the deep problems we face are down to global events – they’re not his fault at all.
<01> �?Don’t judge 14 years on 49 days’, he will say.
<01> **
<01> I want to take that head on.
<01> Because while it is true that the crises we have faced are global in origin, our unique exposure to those crises…
<01> … the reasons we have been hit harder than many comparable countries…
<01> … by the economic impact of covid and then by inflation and rising energy prices…
<01> … can only be explained by choices made by Conservative governments here at home.
<01> And because while the Prime Minister want this election to be about whether inflation is coming down this month…
<01> … he omits to mention when it started to rise:
<01> On his watch as Chancellor;
<01> Even before the Conservatives, in their clamour to cut taxes for those at the very top, sent interest rates and mortgage costs spiralling.
<01> He omits to mention when it peaked too…
<01> … on his watch as Prime Minister.
<01> And he omits to mention the families and businesses dealing with the consequences of Conservative economic mismanagement today.
<01> **
<01> Like the family I met in Redcar:
<01> The dad doing an apprenticeship, the mum working in a supermarket…
<01> … who spend every evening talking about money, because there’s just not enough to pay the bills.
<01> The small business owner in Milton Keynes…
<01> … desperate to expand, but faced with a system of business rates that are stacked against her.
<01> Or just down the road from here, the workers at Alstom, some of whom I met just a few months ago…
<01> … who are facing the uncertainty that results…
<01> … when a government is unwilling to take a long-term, strategic approach, in partnership with business and trade unions…
<01> … the only responsible approach to economic policy.
<01> The Conservatives are insulting the intelligence of millions of people like these, forced to deal with the consequences of their failure.
<01> **
<01> But we won’t let them get away with it.
<01> Because the Conservatives do deserve to be judged on the record of those fourteen years.
<01> The general election, in five weeks’ time, is a chance for the British people to pass judgement on fourteen years of economic chaos and decline under the Conservatives.
<01> Fourteen years that have seen taxes reach a seventy year high.
<01> National debt more than double.
<01> And the typical homeowner re-mortgaging this year paying £240 more every single month, after the disastrous mini-budget.
<01> Wages flat.
<01> Public services on their knees – taxpayers asked to put more and more in, but getting less and less in return.
<01> And economic growth on the floor.
<01> Five Prime Ministers.
<01> Seven Chancellors.
<01> Twelve plans for growth, each yielding less than the last.
<01> To put this into perspective:
<01> If the UK economy had grown at the average rate of OECD economies under the Tories, it would now be £150 billion larger;
<01> An additional £5,000 for every household;
<01> Providing an additional £55 billion more investment in our public services.
<01> **
<01> That is their record – and they deserve to be judged on it.
<01> The Conservatives have failed on the economy.
<01> The plan isn’t working.
<01> And Rishi Sunak’s decision to call an early election is the clearest sign of that.
<01> If he doesn’t believe his plan is working, why should you?
<01> TAX
<01> And no matter how much they tell us that Liz Truss was nothing to do with them, their every action tells us otherwise.
<01> They haven’t learnt their lesson.
<01> They’re singing from the same songbook.
<01> With the Prime Minister’s priorities dissolving into thin air, what is his last, desperate throw of the dice?
<01> Not to deliver on the promises he has made over the last two years.
<01> But instead, to offer up £64 billion worth of unfunded tax cuts.
<01> They offered up another one just last night.
<01> The Conservative cannot say how they’re going to pay for them.
<01> What cuts will they make to public services?
<01> What other taxes will they raise?
<01> Or will they be paid for by yet more borrowing?
<01> And why should anyone believe them, after – I’ll say it again – the tax burden has reached it’s highest in seventy years?
<01> Be in no doubt, the single biggest risk to Britain’s economy is five more years of the Conservative Party.
<01> CHANGED LABOUR
<01> My ambitions for Britain are so much greater than that.
<01> I don’t think we need fantasy economics to look and hope for a better future – just look around us.
<01> But we do need change.
<01> Under Keir’s leadership, we have changed the Labour Party so that we may have the chance to change our country for the better.
<01> To offer a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other.
<01> A party that understands business.
<01> That works with business.
<01> I’m not one of those politicians who thinks the private sector is a dirty word, or a necessary evil.
<01> I’ve worked in the private sector.
<01> Before politics, I worked in financial services in West Yorkshire.
<01> I know what a successful business can do for places like those.
<01> And I know that economic growth comes from the success of businesses, large, medium and small – there is no other way.
<01> I’m not talking about the old trickle down, free market dogmas of the past…
<01> … but instead, a new spirit of partnership between government and business.
<01> An approach fit for a more uncertain world.
<01> I know there is no policy that I can announce…
<01> … no plan that can be drawn up in Whitehall…
<01> … that will not be improved from engagement with business.
<01> And our manifesto will bear the imprint of that engagement.
<01> I want to lead the most pro-growth, pro-business Treasury in our country has ever seen…
<01> … with a laser focus on making working people better off.
<01> Today, more than 120 senior business leaders have signed a letter, expressing their support for a Labour government.
<01> Across the world of business, Labour is being recognised as the natural partner of business;
<01> The party of growth and of enterprise.
<01> **
<01> A few years ago, you might not have expected to hear those things from the Labour Party.
<01> Think how far we have come under Keir’s leadership, in four short years.
<01> If we can change this party, to bring it back to the service of working people;
<01> If we can return it to the centre ground of politics;
<01> If we can bring business back to Labour;
<01> Then I know we can bring business back to Britain.
<01> To bring investment back to Britain.
<01> To bring growth back to Britain.
<01> To bring hope back to Britain.
<01> Because by bringing business back to Britain, we can deliver a better future for working people.
<01> Whatever ideologues on left and right say, it’s not either-or:
<01> This Labour Party understands that business success is crucial to good jobs, and good work is crucial to successful businesses.
<01> It is by bringing business back to Britain that we can create good jobs that pay a decent wage;
<01> Bring in investment to build strong communities with thriving high streets;
<01> Put more money in people’s pockets;
<01> And take pride in goods and services made here in Britain, but exported around the world.
<01> LABOUR’S PLAN
<01> Our plans for growth are built on partnership with business;
<01> A mission-led government, prepared to take on the big challenges that we face and ready to seize the opportunities of the future.
<01> And a government that will build all its plans for the future on the bedrock of economic stability.
<01> It is clearer than ever that at this election, there is a choice between Tory chaos or Labour stability. And stability is change.
<01> Stability, so that we never again see a repeat of the mini budget and the damage it did to family finances.
<01> Stability, so that families and business can plan for the future.
<01> Stability of direction…
<01> … so we can bring together government, business and working people in common purpose…
<01> … to meet the great challenges of our time.
<01> **
<01> That will be underpinned by robust fiscal rules, that get debt falling by the end of the parliament.
<01> I will never play fast and loose with the public finances – because when you do so, you put family finances at risk.
<01> We have started as we mean to go on:
<01> I have been very clear that every policy we announce, and every line in our manifesto, will be fully costed and fully funded.
<01> No ifs, no ands, no buts.
<01> That is the attitude I will take into the Treasury.
<01> Because taxpayers’ money should be spent with the same care with which we spend our own money.
<01> **
<01> I remember how, when I was growing up, my mum used to sit at the kitchen table, combing over, line by line, her bank statements and her receipts.
<01> We weren’t badly off, but we didn’t have money to spare.
<01> To my mum, every penny mattered.
<01> Believe me, I understand – the basic test for whoever is Chancellor is to bring that attitude to the public finances.
<01> **
<01> And stability will rest – as it always has done when Britain has enjoyed economic success – on strong institutions.
<01> I started my career as an economist at the Bank of England.
<01> I know why the stability it brings and its independence from short term politics matter to economic success and the battle against inflation.
<01> So Labour will not play – I will not play – the Tory game of undermining the Treasury or the Bank of England;
<01> And I will introduce a new fiscal lock;
<01> So that any government making significant and permanent changes to tax and spending…
<01> … will be subject to a forecast from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility.
<01> So that there is never a repeat of the mini budget.
<01> Stability must mean something else too – and I have heard time and time again from business how important this is:
<01> Certainty in our tax system;
<01> Which is why we have committed to the publication of a business tax roadmap…
<01> … covering the duration of the parliament, within the first six months of a Labour government;
<01> And it is why corporation tax will be capped at its current rate for the duration of the next Parliament.
<01> That is the lowest rate among G7 economies.
<01> And  should our competitiveness be under threat, we will act.
<01> STABILITY
<01> Stability will be the bedrock of everything we do.
<01> But stability alone is not enough.
<01> It is one, central part of what I call securonomics;
<01> A new approach, which recognises that our age of insecurity requires new answers to new economic challenges.
<01> So stability must stand alongside a plan to fix our weak levels of investment.
<01> Britain today is the only G7 country with investment below 20 percent of GDP.
<01> I am not under the illusion that government can fix this alone – the lifeblood of economic growth is business investment.
<01> So investment will be delivered through a new partnership between government and business;
<01> Embodied in a modern industrial strategy;
<01> And in a new National Wealth Fund…
<01> … with government investing to crowd in tens of billions of pounds of private investment…
<01> … to create the jobs of the future, drive down bills, and achieve energy independence.
<01> **
<01> And we will need reform too.
<01> No more ducking the difficult decisions.
<01> No more shrinking from vested interests.
<01> No more accepting that this is as good as it gets.
<01> So we will reform our politics…
<01> … pushing power out of Westminster so our local and regional leaders can deliver for their areas.
<01> We will reform our skills system…
<01> … to give working people the chance to succeed in a changing world of work…
<01> … replacing the Apprenticeship Levy with a new Growth and Skills Levy.
<01> We will reform our planning system…
<01> … taking head on the single biggest obstacle to growth and investment we face, to get Britain building again.
<01> We will deliver reform for security in work, with a New Deal for Working People.
<01> And we will forge a closer relationship with our nearest neighbours in the European Union, to ease the burden of bureaucracy and red tape on British businesses;
<01> Including a new veterinary agreement, an agreement on touring visas, and the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.
<01> **
<01> Stability, investment, reform.
<01> You’re going to hear those three words a lot from me.
<01> Because they are the ingredients of a genuine plan for the future.
<01> An alternative to managed decline.
<01> The reason that I can say today, with confidence, that this Labour Party is the natural party of British business.
<01> CHANGE
<01> The choice at the next election is simple:
<01> Five more years of the vicious cycle of chaos and decline which the Conservatives have set in motion;
<01> Or a changed Labour Party;
<01> Putting stability first, in the service of working people.
<01> **
<01> We will fight this election on the economy.
<01> Every day we will expose the damage the Conservatives have done…
<01> … the further damage they threaten to do.
<01> And we will set out Labour’s alternative.
<01> Five missions for a decade of national renewal.
<01> And six first steps to point the way to a better Britain.
<01> Cutting NHS waiting times, with 40,000 new appointments every single week;
<01> Launching a new Border Security Command to smash criminal gangs and strengthen our borders;
<01> Setting up Great British Energy, a new, publicly owned clean power company;
<01> Cracking down on antisocial behaviour;
<01> Recruiting 6,500 new teachers;
<01> All fully costed, all fully funded;
<01> All those ambitions built on the bedrock of economic stability.
<01> The foundation stones for a decade of national renewal.
<01> **
<01> To serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer would be the privilege of my life.
<01> Not to luxuriate in status;
<01> Not as a staging post in a career;
<01> But to serve.
<01> I know the responsibility that will come with that.
<01> I embrace it.
<01> I know that it will not be easy.
<01> It will take hard work.
<01> And it will require harder choices.
<01> I am ready for it.
<01> **
<01> As I travel around the country, I see great potential everywhere I go.
<01> In dynamic, great British businesses like this one.
<01> In labs and classrooms in our world-leading universities.
<01> And in the talent and effort of working people.
<01> It is time to unlock that potential.
<01> Turn the page on chaos and decline.
<01> And start a new chapter for Britain.
<01> Labour is ready.
<01> Thank you.
<01> Keir Starmer speech: Country First, Party Second
<01> May 27, 2024
<01> Thank you all for coming here on a Bank Holiday Monday.
<01> At least we’re by the seaside. And we are in Sussex, this is a part of the world I know very well. I have family here – close family. Both my sisters, and my uncle lived for many many years in Worthing.
<01> Now, like everyone, I imagine my character is shaped by where I started in life. I grew up in a small town, not a million miles away from here, a place called Oxted on the Surrey-Kent border.
<01> Similar to Lancing, minus the sea. And should you go to Oxted, some of you could stop off if you’re travelling back to London, you will see a place that, in my opinion, is about as English as it gets.
<01> A mix of Victorian red bricks and pebble-dashed semis while all around you have rolling pastures and the beautiful chalk hills of the North Downs.
<01> I loved growing up there. You could make easy pocket money clearing stones for the local farmers, that was actually my first job. And you could play football until the cows came home – literally. At my first football club, Boulthurst Athletic, we shared our home pitch with the local cows.
<01> It’s part of why I love our country. Not just the beauty – or the football – also the sort of quiet, uncomplaining resilience. The togetherness of the countryside. That is the best of British.
<01> And, to be honest – it’s just as well. Because you need it. I mean – anyone who thinks that hardship in Britain is found only in our cities, anyone who thinks there’s no struggle outside of our cities, yes even here in the South East, let me tell you – they know nothing of the countryside.
<01> My own story is a testament to this. Because it wasn’t easy for us.  My dad was a tool-maker. He worked in a factory – my Mum was a nurse. But for most of her life she had a debilitating illness, Still’s disease. To be honest, she would hate that word, ‘debilitating’, because mum never gave up, she never complained. But her illness did shape our lives.
<01> This was the 1970s of course, so there were hard times. I know what out of control inflation feels like, how the rising cost-of-living can make you scared of the postman coming down the path: “will he bring another bill we can’t afford?”
<01> We used to choose the phone bill because when it got cut off, it was always the easiest to do without. We didn’t have mobiles back then but you could still just about get on with it.
<01> Now, all this has stayed with me. It’s shaped the plan I have drawn up for Britain and the importance, above all, of economic stability. The need to never put working people through the whirlwind of chaos, the rising taxes, rising prices, rising mortgage costs – five thousand pounds for every working family – that’s what the Tories have inflicted on Britain.
<01> The price working people have paid for their chaos, it’s unforgivable.
<01> But as I reflect and look forward to this election I believe my background has also shaped my politics in a deeper way. Look – this England has always felt fairly removed from Westminster. Politics has always been something that happens far away.
<01> And yet something more profound has changed during the last fourteen years of Tory Government. People now feel like more and more of the decisions that affect their community are taken by people who not only live miles away but have little empathy for their challenges.
<01> A politics that is at best doing something to people, not with them. But at its worst, as we saw in horrifying detail in Westminster last week, those twin injustices – the Horizon and Infected Blood scandals, is something much, much darker even than that.
<01> It’s about respect, or to be more precise, the lack of it – that is the canary in the mine of injustice. For a long time now working people have believed opportunity in Britain is stacked against them. But now we are at a dangerous new point close to crossing a rubicon on trust, not just in politics but in so many of the institutions that are meant to serve and protect the British people.
<01> A moment where people no longer believe their values or interests carry the respect of those in power. And when you put that alongside a Government, that over fourteen years has left living standards in this country worse than when they found them, that has torched any semblance of standards in public life, Westminster parties that broke rules they put in place to save lives – rules they expected you to follow but ignored themselves – then you get a crisis in nothing less than who we are as a nation.
<01> The values that have held us together, that have driven us on, through the hard times, towards our greatest achievements, taken to the edge by these Tories.
<01> Healing these wounds is what national renewal means. Politics has to be about service. Britain must be a country that respects your contribution. Everyone – not just those at the top – deserves the chance to get on. These are the ideas I’m fighting for.
<01> This is my project – a Britain once more in the service of working people. Country first, party second.
<01> Now – I don’t know if this is a new politics or whether it’s simply a return to something older that used to be taken for granted.
<01> But public service is the bare minimum you should expect. And you also deserve the security, the certainty, the basic ordinary hope, that Britain will be better for your children. No matter our struggles – we always had that in the 1970s – my parents always believed that, in the end, hard work would be rewarded and Britain would be better for their children. For me.
<01> Now, that might not sound like much to some people but you can’t underestimate how important it is for working class families like mine, how much it comforted my parents.
<01> It gave us a hope and a stability we could build our lives around and I believe it’s what working people want now – more than anything. They want to believe in the future. They want, when they say to their children “work hard and you can achieve anything”, for that to feel true.
<01> But after fourteen years of Tory damage to our values, the service and security they should expect as a given. They just don’t believe it anymore – and that has consequences for all parties.
<01> Look – whatever the polls say, I know there are countless people who haven’t decided how they’ll vote in this election. They’re fed up with the failure, chaos and division of the Tories, but they still have questions about us: has Labour changed enough? Do I trust them with my money, our borders, our security.
<01> My answer is yes you can, because I have changed this party, permanently.
<01> This has been my driving mission since day one. I was determined to change Labour so that it could serve the British people, give them a government that matches the ambition they have for their family and community.
<01> And the very foundation of any good government is economic security, border security, national security. Make no mistake – if the British people give us the opportunity to serve, then this is their core test. It is always their core test. The definition of service. Can you protect this country?
<01> I haven’t worked for four years on this, just to stop now. This is the foundation, the bedrock that our manifesto and our first steps, will be built upon.
<01> And then on that foundation with an end to the Tory chaos. We can start to rebuild our country.
<01> Step one – economic stability. The very foundation of growth, with tough spending rules that mean we can keep inflation, taxes and mortgages low. I am fed up of listening to the Prime Minister tell you we have turned the corner. That is a form of disrespect in itself.
<01> Taxes – higher than at any time since the war. Chaos – hitting every working family to the tune of £5000, and a Prime Minister prepared to do it all over again. He says he wants to get rid of National Insurance. £46bn – that is currently used on your pension and the NHS and he’s not prepared to say how he will fund it.
<01> That means, at this election – either your pension is under threat, or he’s prepared to blow the economy up all over again. He hasn’t learned a thing. Working people need stability. They want things to improve, they want things to move on, they want change.
<01> But they expect you to take care of the public finances as well. Because if you lose control of the economy – it’s working people who pay the price. Liz Truss lost control of the economy. I am not prepared to let a Labour Government ever do that to working people.
<01> That’s why stability is our first step – a non-negotiable pact with working people – the symbol of a changed Labour Party – ready to serve our country.
<01> Step two – we will cut NHS waiting times. 40,000 extra appointments every week paid for by cracking down on tax avoidance and non-doms.
<01> Step three – we will launch a new Border Security Command with new specialist investigators, new resources, and new powers – including counter-terrorism powers. These vile criminals are making a fortune putting vulnerable people in boats made to order, sending them across the busiest shipping lane in the world. Nobody but nobody should be making that journey.
<01> When I was Director of Public Prosecutions – I worked on operations that smashed terrorist gangs across Europe. I will never accept we can’t do the same for these vile gangs. Labour will secure Britain’s borders.
<01> Step Four – we will set up Great British Energy, paid for by a windfall tax on the energy giants who made record profits while your bills went through the roof. A new company – owned by the taxpayer, making money for the taxpayer, harnessing the opportunity of clean British power, making us energy independent, removing Putin’s boot from our throat and cutting bills in your home – for good.
<01> Step five – we’ll crackdown on anti-social behaviour. I don’t want to hear another person tell me this is low-level crime – I’ve been hearing that all my life. It blights communities big and small, it always has. I know Worthing well, as I say – my Uncle lived here. And three years ago – I walked around with the police here, talked to some of the people on the high street and they told me in no uncertain terms the impact anti-social behaviour was having on them.
<01> So we will get more police on the streets in your town. 13,000 new officers and community support officers paid for by cutting down on wasteful contracts.
<01> And step six – we’ll also get 6,500 new teachers in the classroom paid for by removing tax breaks on private schools, a down payment on an education system that we will reform. More creativity, more confidence, more resilience, for all children.
<01> I was the first person in my family to go to university. I know the power of education. Every child should grow up believing that success belongs to them, that they don’t have to change who they are just to get on, that is the Britain we will fight for.
<01> Labour will deliver opportunity for our children.
<01> Now – I am proud of these first steps. They are a new path for our country, a plan that will turn the page, deliver stability and change. And because we have been so ruthless in making sure these policies are deliverable, fully-funded, ready to go.
<01> We also provide the certainty that working people, businesses and communities need. A clear direction. Not the endless spinning around that successive Conservative governments have subjected our country to. The Prime Minister with a new plan every week, a new strategy every month, and at this rate – a new election campaign every day!
<01> I’m not joking. All this spinning round and round, it’s symbolic of the chaos and the instability. You’ve seen that again over the past few days. The desperation of this national service policy – a teenage dad’s army – paid for by cancelling levelling-up funding and money from tax avoidance that we would use to invest in our NHS.
<01> All elections are a choice and this is a clear one: levelling up and the NHS with Labour. Or more desperate chaos with the Tories. That is the choice.
<01> But in a way this desperation tells another story and underlines how elections are about more than individual changes or policies, but about values, temperament, character and a bigger question: whose side are you on? Who do you hold in your mind’s eye when you are making decisions?
<01> Everything I have fought for has been shaped by my life, every change I have made to this party has been about this cause, the answer to that question, the only answer, the working people of this country delivering on their aspirations, earning their respect, serving their interests.
<01> I know those people are looking at this election, looking at me personally. So I make this promise: I will fight for you.
<01> I took this Labour Party four and a half years ago and I changed it into the party you see today. I was criticised for some of the changes I’ve made – change is always like that, there are always people who say don’t do that, don’t go so fast – but whenever I face a fork in the road, at the Crown Prosecution Service, in my work in Northern Ireland, and especially here in the Labour Party… it always comes back to this, the golden thread: country first, Party second.
<01> Because you cannot restore trust and respect with the politics of protest. You cannot move our country forward with gimmicks and gestures. And you cannot truly serve the country if you only do what is convenient, that is why I changed the Labour Party. That is how we serve the British people.
<01> I see no fight in the Prime Minister. No appetite to do the same for his party. They will not change. Seriously – whenever he is confronted by factions in his party, people who are miles away from serving the values of the British people, he caves in – every time. A ‘party-first’ weakness at the heart of his leadership.
<01> Rwanda is the perfect example. He knows it won’t work, he said that. He tried to stop it when he was Chancellor but he was too weak to stand up to his party. He caved in and now he’s gone through with it anyway it’s cost you six hundred million pounds and he’s called an election before it can be tested. Weakness upon weakness.
<01> How do you think working people feel when the Prime Minister says we’ve turned a corner? How do you think they feel when they see the people who did that to their mortgages, swanning around in the House of Lords because he was too weak to stand up to them.
<01> Service isn’t just a word, it requires action. You have to roll up your sleeves and change things for the better. I have changed this Labour party, dragged it back to service, and I will do exactly the same for Westminster – that is the choice at this election: Service or self-interest, stability or chaos, a Labour Party that has changed or a Tory Party that has run away from the mainstream.
<01> The choice is yours. You can stop the chaos, you can turn the page, you can join with us, and together we can rebuild our country.
<01> Thank you.
<01> Keir Starmer delivering a speech on the announcement of the UK General Election
<01> May 22, 2024
<01> Tonight the Prime Minister has finally announced the next General Election.
<01> A moment the country needs – and has been waiting for. And where, by the force of our democracy power returns to you.
<01> A chance to change for the better. Your future. Your community. Your country.
<01> It will feel like a long campaign – I’m sure of that. But no matter what else is said and done. That opportunity for change is what this election is about.
<01> Over the course of the last four years – we have changed the Labour Party. Returned it once more to the service of working people.
<01> All we ask now – humbly – is to do exactly the same for our country. And return Britain to the service of working people. To that purpose.
<01> We offer three reasons why you should change Britain with Labour.
<01> One – because we will stop the chaos.
<01> Look around our country. The sewage in our rivers. People waiting on trolleys in A&E. Crime virtually unpunished. Mortgages and food prices – through the roof.
<01> It’s all – every bit of it – a direct result of the Tory chaos in Westminster.
<01> Time and again, they pursue their own interests. Rather than tackling the issues that affect your family.
<01> And if they get another five years, they will feel entitled to carry on exactly as they are. Nothing will change.
<01> A vote for Labour is a vote for stability – economic and political. A politics that treads more lightly on all our lives. A vote to stop the chaos.
<01> Two – because it’s time for change.
<01> Our offer is to reset both our economy and our politics.
<01> So that they once again serve the interests of working people.
<01> We totally reject the Tory view that economic strength is somehow gifted from those at the top.
<01> Over the past fourteen years – through all the crises we have had to face – sticking with this idea has left our country exposed, insecure and unable to unlock the potential of every community.
<01> But a vote for Labour is a vote to turn the page on all that. A vote for change.
<01> And finally, three – because we have a long-term plan to rebuild Britain. A plan that is ready to go. Fully-costed and fully funded.
<01> We can deliver economic stability. Cut the NHS waiting times. Secure our borders with a New Border Security Command.
<01> Harness Great British Energy to cut your bills for good. Tackle anti-social behaviour.
<01> And get the teachers we need in your children’s classroom.
<01> But most of importantly of all, we do all this with a new spirit of service.
<01> Country first, party second.
<01> A rejection of the gesture politics you will see in this campaign, I have no doubt from the Tories and from the SNP.
<01> I am well aware of the cynicism people hold towards politicians at the moment.
<01> But I came into politics late, having served our country as leader of the Crown Prosecution Service.
<01> And I helped the Police Service in Northern Ireland to gain the consent of all communities.
<01> Service of our country is the reason – and the only reason – why I am standing here now – asking for your vote.
<01> And I believe with patience, determination and that commitment to service there is so much pride and potential we can unlock across our country.
<01> So – here it is – the future of the country – in your hands.
<01> On 4th July you have the choice. And together, we can stop the chaos.
<01> We can turn the page. We can start to rebuild Britain. And change our country.
<01> Thank you.
<01> Why the Conservative Party’s manifesto will mean £4,800 more on your mortgage
<01> Jun 13, 2024
<01> TORY MANIFESTO: THE MONEY'S
<01> NOT THERE
<01> 5 MORE YEARS OF TORY CHAOS
<01> The Conservative manifesto is a desperate wish list of £71 billion worth of unfunded promises that will lead to five more years of chaos and £4,800 more on family mortgages.
<01> The last time the Conservatives played fast and loose with the country’s finances, they crashed the economy and the British people are still paying the price. Rishi Sunak presented himself as the antidote to the chaos of Liz Truss, but he has instead become a tribute act, making the same mistakes, with the same likely results.
<01> The Tories have made £71 billion worth of unfunded promises. However, the money is not there. The Conservatives’ plan will lead to higher borrowing, rising interest rates and £4,800 more on mortgages.
<01> The money’s not there: The Tories’ £71 billion black hole
<01> The Conservatives have made five significant mistakes in their costings:
<01> They claim to have identified £12 billion in savings from the benefits bill, but the vast majority of their proposed changes are already banked in the public finances, and every leading expert disputes the Tories’ ability to deliver savings.
<01> They claim they can fund their pledges through a £6 billion cut in tax avoidance, but their figures omit the £1 billion investment needed to achieve these savings.
<01> Rishi Sunak’s National Service gimmick costs at least double what they have assumed, because they appear not to have taken full account of the costs for accommodation, training and equipment for 30,000 new recruits every single year. Their figures for compulsory community activities have similar holes, especially given the likely training costs involved in the categories they highlight: special constable, NHS support staff and RNLI volunteers. This means they have spent all of their tax avoidance revenue on this policy alone, before all the others they claim it funds.
<01> The Tories are relying on fantasy savings from universities. They cannot raise £1 billion from scrapping poor performing university courses, because they have not set out plans to cap student places.
<01> And their non-existent proposal to save money from government agencies comes with no detail whatsoever, a further £1 billion hole in their plans.
<01> How Tory borrowing will increase your mortgage
<01> With a black hole in their costings, the Tories’ £71 billion worth of unfunded promises would mean an increase in government borrowing. More government borrowing would cause an increase in interest rates. And higher interest rates would cause mortgage rates to rise too.
<01> Labour will not raise taxes on working people
<01> Jun 10, 2024
<01> Labour will not increase income tax, national insurance or VAT. Unlike the Tories, we have been clear about how we will pay for our first steps in government: by making the tax system fairer.
<01> Ending tax breaks for private schools, which exempt them from VAT and business rates.
<01> Closing the loopholes which allow some ‘non-dom’ mega rich people who live in the UK to avoid paying tax.
<01> Introducing a proper windfall tax on the huge profits the energy giants are making.
<01> We will deliver economic stability with tough spending rules, so we can grow our economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.
<01> The Tories have hiked taxes
<01> Under Rishi Sunak, the tax burden in the UK is at its highest level in 70 years. Households will be on average £870 worse off under the Tories.
<01> Despite this, public services like the NHS are on their knees.
<01> After 14 years in power, the Conservative Government has failed on the economy, failed on public services and failed on living standards.
<01> Why has tax in the UK risen?
<01> With Liz Truss as Prime Minister, the Conservatives crashed the British economy – and they are now making the British public pay to clean up the mess.
<01> And while the Tories have piled tax rises on the shoulders of working people and businesses, they are keeping unfair loopholes open, and letting government waste and fraud spiral.
<01> Now Rishi Sunak is planning on repeating the mistakes of the disastrous Liz Truss mini-budget, with £71 billion worth of unfunded spending pledges.
<01> How Labour will bring stability back to the economy
<01> Labour will ensure that no future government can inflict the devastation on working families that Liz Truss and the Conservatives did.
<01> We will introduce a new fiscal lock, guaranteeing in law that any government making significant tax and spending changes will be subject to an independent forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility.
<01> Labour will tax fairly and levy a proper windfall tax on the huge profits the energy giants are making, and end the tax loophole which exempts private schools from VAT and business rates.
<01> How Labour will give business the confidence to invest
<01> To bring stability, an incoming Labour government will publish a roadmap for business taxation, setting out our plans on business tax over the duration of the parliament.
<01> If we expect business to invest in Britain, then tax rates cannot shoot up and down like a yo-yo.
<01> For the period of the next parliament, Labour will also cap the headline rate of corporation tax at its current rate of 25 per cent, the lowest in the G7.
<01> How Labour will clamp down on tax avoidance
<01> Labour will target raising an extra £5 billion a year by closing the loopholes in Rishi Sunak’s ‘non-dom’ plan and cracking down on tax dodgers.
<01> The gap between the amount of tax owed and what the government collects rose to a staggering £36 billion in 2021/22 – an increase of £5 billion from the year before.
<01> The head of the National Audit Office has said that there is £6 billion a year that could be recovered through a concerted effort on tax avoidance. The Tories are only promising to recover £1 billion a year in outstanding tax debt.
<01> Labour will invest £855 million of additional funding will go to HMRC each year to boost tax income. The plan would raise a net £5 billion a year by the end of the parliament.
<01> Labour’s Child Health Action Plan will create the healthiest generation of children ever
<01> Jun 10, 2024
<01> There is no more important indicator of the state of a country than the wellbeing of its children.
<01> The future is our children and today they are suffering.
<01> More face mental health issues with treatment too slow, more are going to hospital because of tooth decay, and more are growing up obese through no fault of their own.
<01> The cause is clear. The nation’s children are the biggest casualty of the short term ‘sticking plaster’ politics of the last 14 years.
<01> When the Government is deeply divided, on its fifth Prime Minister in seven years, and sees getting to the end of the week without catastrophe as a major success, then long term planning goes out the window. That is happening now – and children are suffering.
<01> “We want the next generation to be chasing their dreams, not a dentist appointment. They should be aspiring to reach their potential, not reach a doctor.“
<01> Keir Starmer MP
<01> That’s why it’s time for a change. We need to restore our sense of what’s possible. That the future for our children can be the better, more prosperous and healthier. We need a bold new ambition: for this to be the healthiest generation of children ever.
<01> A core mission of the next Labour government is to get the NHS back on its feet after 14 years of neglect under the Tories. By doing that, the health service will be able reverse the plummeting health outcomes our children suffer from.
<01> Labour’s Child Health Action Plan:
<01> 1. Cut waiting lists for children
<01> Labour will cut waiting times for planned paediatric services by getting the NHS working round the clock delivering 40,000 planned care appointments.
<01> How will Labour pay for this?
<01> By clamping down on tax dodgers and closing non-dom loopholes.
<01> 2. Provide mental health support for children in school
<01> Introduce specialist mental health support for children and young people in every school.
<01> How will Labour pay for this?
<01> By abolishing tax breaks for private schools.
<01> 3. Boost preventative mental health services
<01> Roll out Young Futures hubs in every community to provide children with preventative mental health support.
<01> Recruit 8,500 specially trained staff across CAMHS and NHS talk therapies.
<01> How will Labour pay for this?
<01> By abolishing tax loopholes for private equity providers and tax breaks for private schools.
<01> 4. Transform NHS dentistry
<01> Labour will eliminate dental deserts and improve children’s oral healthy by:
<01> Delivering 700,000 extra urgent dental appointments per year, so more children can see a dentist when they really need to.
<01> Introducing a targeted national supervised toothbrushing programme for 3-5-year-olds in our fully funded breakfast clubs.
<01> 5. Crackdown on smoking and vaping
<01> Labour will stop children and young people being exposed to the harmful effects of tobacco and vaping by:
<01> Legislating for a progressive ban on smoking, so the next generation are not addicted.
<01> Making all hospital trusts integrate ‘opt-out’ smoking cessation interventions into routine care, with a named lead on smoking cessation, so parents have all the support they need to quit.
<01> Clamping down on underage vaping by banning vapes from being branded and advertised to appeal to children.
<01> 6. Ban junk food advertising to children
<01> Labour will tackle childhood obesity by:
<01> Implementing the 9pm watershed for junk food advertising on television and ban paid-for advertising of less healthy foods on online media aimed at children.
<01> Getting kids moving, by implementing a mandatory national curriculum that is balanced and broad, and makes a wide range of physical activities compulsory for all schools.
<01> 7. Introduce breakfast clubs for all primary school children
<01> A free breakfast club in every primary school so every child is able to start the day with a healthy breakfast and parents are able to get to work.
<01> How will Labour pay for this?
<01> By clamping down on tax dodgers and closing non-dom loopholes.
<01> 8. Protect children from the growth of infectious diseases
<01> Deliver on the NHS workforce plan, training more health visitors so parents and babies get the best possible support.
<01> Reforming the service to allow health visitors to administer routine immunisations to vulnerable and at-risk children, ensuring more are protected from infectious diseases.
<01> 9. Ban the sale of dangerous highly caffeinated energy drinks to under-16s
<01> Dangerously high caffeinated energy drinks containing over 150mg of caffeine per litre will be banned from sale in retail outlets and online to under 16s, as it has become clear to health and education experts that the current caffeine labelling system is failing to prevent young children from purchasing these drinks.
<01> The ban will be in line with current labelling and enforced through trading standards.
<01> 10. Stop the targeting of school children by fast food outlets
<01> By empowering councils to block the development of new fast food shops outside schools
<01> Labour’s new approach to deliver the Child Health Action Plan
<01> A neighbourhood NHS
<01> Labour will shift care out of the hospital and into the community.
<01> This means:
<01> Allowing for different routes to access referrals (subject to advice from NICE), saving GPs time by allowing professionals like opticians to refer children who need more serious healthcare interventions.
<01> Training more health visitors so parents don’t always end up having to seek help from the GP or A&E because they can’t get the advice they need about their baby’s health.
<01> Bringing back the family doctor by cutting red tape so GPs can spend their time seeing patients rather than on admin, and introducing an incentive to provide continuity of care.
<01> Joining up health and care service by trialling community health centres in each area, bringing together professionals like GPs, district nurses, physiotherapists, dentists, and pharmacists under one roof.
<01> A digital NHS
<01> Labour will shift from an analogue system to a digital one .
<01> This means:
<01> Making the NHS app a one-stop shop for health information and making sure every parent has the information and skills they need to give their child the best start in life.
<01> Digitising the Red Book (Children’s Health Record) to make it easier to access health records for parents and children, informing the best choices.
<01> Improving coordination between education, the health service, social care and the wider services that support families by piloting the expansion of a children’s number, ensuring that no child falls through the gaps.
<01> Introducing a new Fit for the Future fund, paid for by by clamping down on tax dodgers and closing non-dom loopholes so we can double the number of high tech, artificial intelligence enabled scanners in the NHS, to aid early diagnostics and bring down the waiting list.
<01> A prevention-first NHS
<01> Labour will shift the focus of the health system towards prevention with a goal to improve healthy life expectancy for all and halve the gap in healthy life expectancy between different regions of England within ten years.
<01> The next Labour government will shift the focus of government departments, the NHS, and wider public services to prevention by embedding long-term planning.
<01> This means:
<01> Catching problems early, with healthcare in communities so people don’t allow problems to fester, and stat-of-the-art diagnostic equipment to get results as soon as possible.
<01> Creating a national framework that ensures focus and innovation across government, business, public services, and civil society is targeted towards delivering this long-term goal.
<01> Establishing a mission delivery board at the heart of Government to tackle poor health bringing together all departments with an influence over the social determinants of health.
<01> This action plan represents an important stepping stone on the way to the Labour Manifesto which will be issued close to the election date. It represents a fresh approach and a renewed sense of purpose for health.
<01> Labour Party pensions policy: We will keep the pension triple lock and give pensioners security in retirement
<01> Jun 9, 2024
<01> Labour will protect the triple lock on pensions and increase the state pension each year in line with inflation, average earnings, or by 2.5 per cent, whichever is higher.
<01> We will support pensioners and give them the dignity and security they deserve in retirement. All our plans are fully funded, and we will introduce tough spending roles to keep mortgages, inflation and taxes as low as possible. Delivering economic stability is our first step for change.
<01> We will cut energy bills for good with Great British Energy, a publicly owned energy company, and insulate millions of cold, draughty homes. We will cut NHS waiting lists, with 40,000 appointments each week, paid for by cracking down on tax avoidance and non-doms.
<01> How the Tories have hit pensioners with a tax bombshell
<01> Rishi Sunak has failed pensioners.
<01> Over the last 14 years, pensioners have paid a heavy price for Tory failure. A crashed economy, plummeting living standards, health and social care on its knees, rising crime and the highest tax burden in 70 years.
<01> Record numbers are now paying income tax, with stealth tax rises announced by Sunak set to hammer eight million pensioners with an average rise of £1,000.
<01> Even with their latest unfunded pledge, the Tories are still taking £3 from pensioners and expect them to be thankful for getting £1 back.
<01> There are 300,000 more pensioners living in poverty under the Tories. The last Labour Government lifted over a million pensioners out of poverty.
<01> The Tories’ £71 billion worth of unfunded spending commitments also threatens the future of the State Pension. They have refused to answer how the State Pension will be funded if they achieve their ambition of abolishing National Insurance Contributions.
<01> If the cost of the Tories’ black hole was fully met by raising Income Tax, an average pensioner could be paying hundreds of pounds more in tax.
<01> The economic failure of Rishi Sunak is leaving pensioners across the country worse off.
<01> How Labour will support pensioners
<01> Labour will turn the page on Tory chaos with economic security and political stability.
<01> A Labour government will protect the triple lock on pensions and review the current state of the pensions and retirement savings landscape, to check if the current framework can deliver sustainable retirement incomes for people.
<01> We will also give the Pensions Regulator new powers to intervene where schemes fail to offer sufficient value for their members.
<01> Liz Kendall, Labour’s Shadow Pensions Secretary has said: “Retirement should be a time we all look forward to, but more pensioners than ever are renting into retirement, their children are returning home because they’re locked out of the housing market and soaring childcare costs mean pensioners are taking on more responsibilities they weren’t expecting.
<01> “My message to pensioners at this general election is simple – look at your wallet, look at the quality of your healthcare and look at the lack of housing for your children and grandchildren and ask yourself, is this as good as it gets?”
<01> Labour’s plan for childcare and early education
<01> Jun 9, 2024The Tories have broken childcare, so Labour will fix it.  Labour has a clear plan for childcare and early education, giving every child life chances and every parent work choices.
<01> Because after 14 years, all our children deserve better than a promise the Chancellor made, which even he won’t guarantee – a Tory pledge without a plan that risks crashing the childcare system, like Liz Truss crashed the economy. That’s why Labour will ensure the hours that parents have been promised are delivered.
<01> Labour’s plan has been built by learning from how childcare works the world over, from Ireland to Australia. It stretches from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school, because every parent knows that childcare costs don’t end when children start school.
<01> Labour is determined to deliver not just more childcare, but better childcare and early education – for the best start to every life.
<01> With Labour:
<01> Childcare will be available and accessible
<01> Over three thousand new nursery classes across England to open up access to childcare hours for families. Spare school classrooms will be converted into high quality spaces for nurseries, paid for by ending the tax breaks private schools enjoy.
<01> Labour Lords have already ended the outdated restrictions preventing councils offering childcare themselves.
<01> Childcare will support our children to achieve and thrive
<01> Labour will deliver half a million more children hitting the Early Learning Goals by 2030.
<01> Labour will bring a new focus on supporting language skills and maths learning right from the start.
<01> Labour will support staff working in childcare & early education so they are recognised for the skilled and important work they are doing.
<01> Labour has commissioned Sir David Bell, former chief inspector of Ofsted, to look at how we can drive up standards in childcare in England.
<01> Childcare will be affordable
<01> Labour will deliver the enhanced entitlements the government have offered, saving thousands of pounds a year for working families.
<01> Labour will support three quarters of a million more parents to re-enter the labour market.
<01> Childcare won’t end when children start school
<01> Labour will provide free breakfast clubs in every primary school in England, paid for by ending tax loopholes and clamping down on tax evasion.
<01> Breakfast clubs drive up attendance and standards and improve behaviour and attainment, because it’s about the club not just the breakfast.
<01> We’ll give parents choices for an earlier start to the working day – helping families to get on not just get by.
<01> Labour Party prisons policy: How we will fix the prisons crisis and keep criminals behind bars
<01> Jun 9, 2024
<01> Labour will fix the prisons crisis by driving through a prisons building programme, as part of our mission to take back our streets and tackle crime and antisocial behaviour.
<01> Overcrowding has made our prisons a powder keg waiting to explode and led to the government instructing the police to arrest fewer criminals and deliberately delay court hearings to stem the flow into prisons.
<01> No wonder millions do not feel safe on the streets and many people are frightened to leave their homes.
<01> The Tories have failed our prisons
<01> The Tories promised to create 20,000 additional prison places, but 10 Justice Secretaries in 10 chaotic years have failed to deliver, with just 6,000 places being built, and the programme delayed.
<01> This failure has left jails bursting at the seams, with criminals – including domestic abusers, one of which who was described as “a risk to children” – now being released up to 70 days early, creating a potential risk to the public.
<01> Prison staff are also increasingly at risk. The number of assaults on staff have risen from 3,266 to 9,204 in 10 years, an increase of 182%. That is 177 assaults on staff per week.
<01> Rishi Sunak has turned prisons into breeding grounds for crime which are creating ever more hardened criminals. Some 80% of those entering prison for the first time today have a previous offence or caution, at a cost of an astonishing £18bn to the taxpayer.
<01> How Labour will fix prisons
<01> As part of plans to make Britain’s streets safer, a Labour government will:
<01> Take control of the planning process by classifying prisons as being of ‘national importance’ on public safety grounds, so the approval decision is in ministers’ hands.
<01> Deliver the 20,000 promised jail places to ensure there is always enough space to lock up the most dangerous offenders
<01> Bring together prison governors and local employers to create Employment Councils to drive down reoffending, linking offenders to training and jobs, and reducing the burden on capacity in the long term.
<01> How Labour will tackle crime and antisocial behaviour
<01> Labour has an ambitious plan to take back our streets that the Tories have abandoned.
<01> Putting 13,000 more neighbourhood police and PCSOs on the beat, funded by a new police efficiency programme on procurement and shared services based on the work of the Police Foundation.
<01> Cracking down on anti-social behaviour through tough new Respect Orders with criminal sanctions for persistent anti-social behaviour.
<01> Giving teenagers the best start in life with new youth hubs, containing mental health staff and youth workers to tackle the crisis in mental health, give teenagers the support they need and prevent knife crime.
<01> Tackling shoplifting gangs by ending the rule brought in by the Tories which stops shop thefts under £200 being investigated.
<01> Take back our streets
<01> Labour believes that security is the bedrock on which opportunities are built, communities can thrive, and local economies can prosper. Security means knowing someone will be there for you if things go wrong, and that laws will be respected and enforced.
<01> But that sense of security has slowly eroded over the past 14 years, with rising levels of violent crime, a knife crime epidemic devastating young lives, and shamefully and persistently high rates of violence against women and girls.
<01> Anti-social behaviour is a blight on society, with drug misuse, fly-tipping and off-road biking increasing in our communities, alongside an epidemic in shoplifting in our town centres. Too often this is dismissed as low-level crime, but it matters hugely to people and hits the very heart of our communities.
<01> At the same time, confidence that there will be any consequences when a crime is committed has collapsed. Too often people fear that when things go wrong, no one will come and nothing will be done. That is the Tories’ abysmal record on crime and justice – criminals laughing at the law and victims paying the price.
<01> Labour will rebuild security on Britain’s streets – with a mission to halve serious violence and rebuild confidence in policing and the criminal justice system.
<01> Labour’s first step towards our mission take back our streets
<01> As a first step for change on our streets, Labour will crack down on antisocial behaviour, with more neighbourhood police paid for by ending wasteful contracts, tough new penalties for offenders, and a new network of youth hubs.
<01> Labour’s pledge to put 13,000 extra neighbourhood police and PCSOs on the beat will give every community a named officer they can get in touch with, so policing gets back to doing what it’s supposed to do.
<01> Labour's first steps for change
<01> 1. Deliver economic stability
<01> 2. Cut NHS waiting times
<01> 3. Launch a new Border Security Command
<01> 4. Set up Great British Energy
<01> 5. Crack down on antisocial behaviour
<01> 6. Recruit 6,500 new teachers
<01> Manifesto
<01> My plan for change
<01> This election is about change.
<01> A chance to stop the endless Conservative chaos that has directly harmed the finances of every family in Britain.
<01> A moment where we can turn the page on a set of ideas that, over 14 years, have consistently left us more vulnerable in an increasingly volatile world.
<01> And an opportunity to begin the work of national renewal. A rebuilding of our country, so that it once again serves the interests of working people.
<01> Restore hope
<01> Every great nation is held together by shared beliefs. To outsiders they may not seem exceptional or distinctive, but they are essential for a sense of collective national purpose. Britain is no different, but at this moment two of our most important beliefs are in grave danger.
<01> First, that politics should be driven by a sense of service to the country, not considerations of party or self-interest.
<01> Second, that if you work hard then – whoever you are, wherever you started in life – Britain is a country that will respect your contribution and give you a fair chance to get on.
<01> When I consider these beliefs, it is hard not to think back to my childhood. Then, as now, Britain’s place in the world was uncertain. Then, as now, our economy was gripped by stuttering growth and a cost-of-living crisis that hurt working people.
<01> Yet back then, there was at least a degree of security in being able to take those two fundamental beliefs for granted. For families like mine, this was a comfort. The knowledge that Britain would offer your children a better future gave us hope. A hope that may not sound high-minded or particularly idealistic, but which families like mine could build a life around.
<01> Stop the chaos
<01> To restore this hope, we must first end the Conservative chaos. The visible decline in our communities – families weighed down by soaring mortgages; people waiting on trolleys in A&E; sewage in our rivers – is not an accident. Rather, it is a direct result of a governing party that, time and again, puts its own interests and obsessions above the issues that affect families.
<01> The result is a vicious cycle – decline feeding off chaos, chaos feeding off decline – that will continue if they return for five more years. Only a Labour government can break this cycle and stop the chaos.
<01> Turn the page
<01> We must turn the page decisively on the Conservative ideas that have caused the chaos.
<01> The world has become increasingly volatile, with a major war in Europe for the first time in a generation and ever greater threats to the living standards of working people. This ‘age of insecurity’ requires the government to step up, not stand aside.
<01> This means a return to the foundations of good government: national security, secure borders, and economic stability. But it also requires an enduring partnership with business to deliver the economic growth we need. It needs more focus on long- term strategy, not the short-term distractions that can animate Westminster. And it demands a final and total rejection of the toxic idea that economic growth is gifted from the few to the many.
<01> Because whether it is crashing the pound to give tax cuts to the richest 1%; degrading public services because of a mess made by the banks; or the failure to invest in clean British energy that left us exposed when Putin invaded Ukraine – so much of what Britain has been through in the past 14 years is explained by a Conservative failure to face the future. Only Labour can turn the page.
<01> Rebuild our country
<01> We must rebuild our country. It will not be easy. Not only because there is no quick fix to the mess the Conservatives have made. But also, because their failures have sapped our collective confidence that Britain can still achieve great things. I reject this with every fibre of my being. Despite all the chaos inflicted on Britain, the country I see is one where working people never let each other down. They came together in the pandemic – missed weddings, funerals and last goodbyes – to save the lives of people they will never meet. They dug deep in the years of austerity, to keep delivering the public services people needed. And throughout the cost-of-living crisis, they found a way to support those less fortunate than themselves.
<01> We are still a great nation. We can still achieve great things. What we lack is a government that can match the ambition working people have for their family and community, with a credible long-term plan.
<01> This manifesto is that plan. Fully costed, fully funded – built on a rock of fiscal responsibility.
<01> At its heart are five national missions – with clear first steps to begin the journey of rebuilding – that provide a clear destination for everyone invested in Britain’s future. A new Britain, where wealth is created in every community. Where the golden opportunity of clean British power is harnessed for lower bills. Where your town centre has been revitalised and everyone feels safe to walk the streets. Where you can go to work and know you will be treated with dignity and respect. Where our children are equipped with the skills to thrive in the future. Where our NHS is once again at the cutting edge of healthcare. And where we show that politics can be about serving the country.
<01> It’s time for change
<01> I know some people will roll their eyes at this last sentence. Yet serving our country is the only reason I came into politics. The defining purpose of my Labour leadership has been to drag my party away from the dead end of gesture politics and return it once more to the service of working people. I have changed my party. Now I want the chance to bring that change to the country.
<01> But to succeed we need everyone, every community, to play their part. I know, after everything you have been through in the past 14 years, that this is a hard request to make. But I also expect, deep down, that you know this is what our country needs now – an end to the chaos, a turning of the page, and a patient but determined rebuilding of our country.
<01> So, I invite you to join us in this common endeavour of national renewal. It is time to change Britain.
<01> Keir Starmer
<01> Leader of the Labour Party
<01> Help deliver change to Britain.
<01> Labour’s first steps for change
<01> 1. Deliver economic stability
<01> 2. Cut NHS waiting times
<01> 3. Launch a new Border Security Command
<01> 4. Set up Great British Energy
<01> 5. Crack down on antisocial behaviour
<01> 6. Recruit 6,500 new teachers
<01> Labour’s first steps will:
<01> 1. Deliver economic stability with tough spending rules, so we can grow our economy and keep taxes, inflation and mortgages as low as possible.
<01> 2. Cut NHS waiting times with 40,000 more appointments each week, during evenings and weekends, paid for by cracking down on tax avoidance and non-dom loopholes.
<01> 3. Launch a new Border Security Command with hundreds of new specialist investigators and use counter-terror powers to smash criminal boat gangs.
<01> 4. Set up Great British Energy, a publicly-owned clean power company, to cut bills for good and boost energy security, paid for by a windfall tax on oil and gas giants.
<01> 5. Crack down on antisocial behaviour, with more neighbourhood police paid for by ending wasteful contracts, tough new penalties for offenders, and a new network of youth hubs.
<01> 6. Recruit 6,500 new teachers in key subjects to set children up for life, work and the future, paid for by ending tax breaks for private schools.
<01> Help deliver change to Britain.
<01> Mission-driven government
<01> Ending the Conservative chaos is vital, but turning the page with a new government is not in itself enough to tackle the deep-rooted challenges our country now faces. To rebuild Britain, we need to change how Britain is governed.
<01> For too long, Britain has been held back by governments that, because they lack a relentless focus on long-term ends, are buffeted about by events. Politics has enormous potential to change lives for the better, but too often different parts of the government have pursued their own narrow goals rather than working together. Government is at its best when working in partnership with business, trade unions, civil society, faith groups, and communities. But without a shared project those partnerships barely get off the ground.
<01> So, as well as a new administration with new priorities, Britain needs a new approach: mission-driven government.
<01> Mission-driven government means raising our sights as a nation and focusing on ambitious, measurable, long-term objectives that provide a driving sense of purpose for the country. It means a new way of doing government that is more joined up, pushes power out to communities and harnesses new technology, all with one aim in mind – to put the country back in the service of working people.
<01> Labour’s five missions to rebuild Britain
<01> 1) Kickstart economic growth
<01> to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7 – with good jobs and productivity growth in every part of the country making everyone, not just a few, better off.
<01> 2) Make Britain a clean energy superpower
<01> to cut bills, create jobs and deliver security with cheaper, zero-carbon electricity by 2030, accelerating to net zero.
<01> 3) Take back our streets
<01> by halving serious violent crime and raising confidence in the police and criminal justice system to its highest levels.
<01> 4) Break down barriers to opportunity
<01> by reforming our childcare and education systems, to make sure there is no class ceiling on the ambitions of young people in Britain.
<01> 5) Build an NHS fit for the future
<01> that is there when people need it; with fewer lives lost to the biggest killers; in a fairer Britain, where everyone lives well for longer.
<01> Delivering the change Britain needs will require perseverance. The starting point for delivering these missions is to ensure the foundations of good government are right. Labour will make sure we have strong national security, secure borders, and economic stability. Building on these secure foundations, we have already set out the first steps for change. Today we present further policies in this manifesto, as part of the journey of rebuilding our country.
<01> Help deliver change to Britain.
<01> Strong foundations
<01> National security
<01> No policy commitment in pursuit of Labour’s missions matters unless we uphold the first duty of any government: to keep the country safe. Peace and security are hard earned. They require constant vigilance. Over the last 14 years geopolitical tensions have risen, while the Conservatives have hollowed out our armed forces. Now Putin is attempting to break European security with his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Labour will meet this challenge by strengthening our armed forces and protecting our national security.
<01> Our commitment to the UK’s nuclear deterrent is absolute. It is a vital safeguard for the UK and our NATO allies. As the party that founded NATO, we maintain our unshakeable commitment to the alliance, and we will apply a NATO test to major defence programmes to ensure we meet our obligations in full.
<01> In recent years, threats to our safety and security have multiplied and diversified. Alongside greater conventional threats, we are faced with the growing emergence of hybrid warfare, including cyber-attacks and misinformation campaigns which seek to subvert our democracy. To ensure the UK is fully prepared to deal with these interconnected threats, Labour will conduct a Strategic Defence Review within our first year in government, and we will set out the path to spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence.
<01> From the Skripal poisonings to assassination plots by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, threats from hostile states or state-sponsored groups are on the rise, but Britain lacks a comprehensive framework to protect us. Labour will take the approach used for dealing with non-state terrorism and adapt it to deal with state-based domestic security threats.
<01> Terrorism remains a significant threat. Labour will bring in ‘Martyn’s Law’ to strengthen the security of public events and venues. We will update the rules around counter-extremism, including online, to stop people being radicalised and drawn towards hateful ideologies. Labour will also ensure the police and intelligence services have the powers and resources they need to protect the British people from terrorism and hostile espionage.
<01> Secure borders
<01> Britain is a tolerant and compassionate country. We have a proud tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and abuse. Schemes like Homes for Ukraine, Hong Kong humanitarian visas, and the Syrian resettlement programme have provided important routes for refugees seeking sanctuary. But the system needs to be controlled and managed and we need strong borders. The small boats crisis, fuelled by dangerous criminal smuggler gangs, is undermining our security and costing lives.
<01> Rather than a serious plan to confront this crisis, the Conservatives have offered nothing but desperate gimmicks. Their flagship policy – to fly a tiny number of asylum seekers to Rwanda – has already cost hundreds of millions of pounds. Even if it got off the ground, this scheme can only address fewer than one per cent of the asylum seekers arriving. It cannot work. Chaos in the Channel has been matched by chaos at home. The Conservatives’ unworkable laws have created a ‘perma-backlog’ of tens of thousands of asylum seekers, who are indefinitely staying in hotels costing the taxpayer millions of pounds every week.
<01> Labour will stop the chaos and go after the criminal gangs who trade in driving this crisis. We will create a new Border Security Command, with hundreds of new investigators, intelligence officers, and cross-border police officers. This will be funded by ending the wasteful Migration and Economic Development partnership with Rwanda. This new Command will work internationally and be supported by new counter-terrorism style powers, to pursue, disrupt, and arrest those responsible for the vile trade. We will seek a new security agreement with the EU to ensure access to real-time intelligence and enable our policing teams to lead joint investigations with their European counterparts.
<01> Labour will turn the page and restore order to the asylum system so that it operates swiftly, firmly, and fairly; and the rules are properly enforced. We will hire additional caseworkers to clear the Conservatives’ backlog and end asylum hotels, saving the taxpayer billions of pounds.
<01> Labour will set up a new returns and enforcement unit, with an additional 1,000 staff, to fast-track removals to safe countries for people who do not have the right to stay here. We will negotiate additional returns arrangements to speed up returns and increase the number of safe countries that failed asylum seekers can swiftly be sent back to. And we will also act upstream, working with international partners to address the humanitarian crises which lead people to flee their homes, and to strengthen support for refugees in their home region.
<01> Economic stability
<01> Every commitment a Labour government makes will be based on sound money and economic stability. This is a non-negotiable principle for our changed Labour Party. Siren voices may claim that there are no limits on what government can spend, or that tax cuts pay for themselves. We reject this flawed ideology that was tested to destruction by the disastrous Conservative ‘mini budget’. The British people are still paying the price of those unfunded commitments through higher mortgage costs, and taxpayers continue to foot the bill through higher interest payments, meaning less money for investment and public services. The impact was not confined to these shores. The Conservatives’ recklessness sent a signal of instability across the world that damaged our standing, making Britain a less attractive place for business to invest.
<01> The chaos is not over. The desperate Conservatives have now made yet more unfunded tax cuts and spending promises at a scale beyond the ‘mini budget’. This would be devastating for families across the country.
<01> Labour will turn the page on this economic chaos. Our approach is based on strong fiscal rules which will govern every single decision we make in government.
<01> Our fiscal rules are that:
<01> The current budget moves into balance, so that day-to-day costs are met by revenues
<01> Debt must be falling as a share of the economy by the fifth year of the forecast.
<01> These rules allow for prudent investment in our economy. This represents a clear break from the Conservatives who have created an incentive to cut investment; a short-term approach that ignores the importance of growing the economy. Labour will strike a balance between prioritising investment and the urgent need to rebuild our public finances. There will be no return to austerity.
<01> Unlike the Conservatives, Labour will never sideline the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for political convenience. Instead, we will strengthen the role of the OBR. Every fiscal event making significant changes to taxation or spending will be subject to an independent OBR forecast.
<01> Labour will safeguard taxpayers’ money. We will end the link between access to ministers and an inside track for public contracts. We will appoint a fixed-term Covid Corruption Commissioner and use every means possible to recoup public money lost in pandemic-related fraud and from contracts which have not delivered. And we will not tolerate fraud or waste anywhere, whether in social security or the excessive use of consultants.
<01> Alongside strong national finances, Britain needs resilient family finances too. The Conservatives have left families struggling with the cost of living. Labour will take action to support families, by tackling the underlying causes of the crisis.
<01> We will bring down the cost of energy. We will reduce food prices by removing barriers to businesses trading. We will make housing more affordable, expand access to childcare, and make work pay. We will support families with children by introducing free breakfast clubs in every primary school. Labour will also keep mortgage rates as low as possible, with a strong, independent Bank of England – which will continue to target stable inflation of 2 per cent.
<01> The Conservatives have raised the tax burden to a 70-year high. We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible. Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT.
<01> Labour will address unfairness in the tax system. We will abolish non-dom status once and for all, replacing it with a modern scheme for people genuinely in the country for a short period. We will end the use of offshore trusts to avoid inheritance tax so that everyone who makes their home here in the UK pays their taxes here. Private equity is the only industry where performance-related pay is treated as capital gains. Labour will close this loophole.
<01> We will modernise HMRC and change the law to tackle tax avoidance. We will increase registration and reporting requirements, strengthen HMRC’s powers, invest in new technology and build capacity within HMRC. This, combined with a renewed focus on tax avoidance by large businesses and the wealthy, will begin to close the tax gap and ensure everyone pays their fair share.
<01> Labour will stop the chaos, turn the page, and return to the foundations of national security, secure borders, and economic stability.
<01> Help deliver change to Britain.
<01> Kickstart economic growth
<01> How Labour will kickstart economic growth:
<01> Deliver economic stability with tough spending rules
<01> A new partnership with business to boost growth everywhere
<01> A National Wealth Fund to invest in jobs
<01> Planning reform to build 1.5 million new homes
<01> Devolution of power across England
<01> A New Deal for Working People
<01> Sustained economic growth is the only route to improving the prosperity of our country and the living standards of working people. That is why it is Labour’s first mission for government. It means being pro-business and pro-worker. We are the party of wealth creation.
<01> This election follows the chaos of the Conservatives’ ‘mini-budget’ and an unprecedented fall in living standards. Their miserable economic record over the past 14 years has seen productivity and wages flatlining, leaving British families significantly poorer than those in France or Germany.
<01> This decline is rooted in two failures.
<01> First, an inability to accept that a strong economy can only be built on the contribution of every community and every person – the many not the few. Second, a failure to acknowledge that sustainable growth requires government to be a strategic partner with business – that markets must be shaped, not merely served.
<01> These twin failures have led to greater economic insecurity – in the financial resilience of households, but also in our national economy – at the very time when our world has become less stable and secure. The Conservatives have failed to grasp the implications of a new era of rising global competition and tension, instead leaving our economy on an increasingly shallow and insecure footing.
<01> It is time to turn the page. Labour will restore stability, increase investment, and reform our economy.
<01> We will embrace a new approach to economic management – securonomics – that understands sustainable growth relies on a broad base and resilient foundations. Our approach will depend on a dynamic and strategic state. This does not mean ever-growing government, but it does mean a more active, smarter government that works in partnership with business, trade unions, local leaders, and devolved governments.
<01> Labour will stop the chaos and support business through a stable policy environment – strengthening our economic institutions, and giving investors the certainty they need to fuel growth. Labour will seek involvement from industry, trade unions, and civil society in our plans for growth, so they can contribute to building a stronger economy in all parts of the country. We will strategically use public investment where it can unlock additional private sector investment, create jobs, and provide a return for taxpayers.
<01> While stability and greater investment will support growth, parts of our economy require substantial reform if we are to create the wealth our country needs. Britain is hampered by a planning regime that means we struggle to build either the infrastructure or housing the country needs.
<01> The country remains too centralised, with the economic potential of too many regions and communities ignored. Our labour market fails to provide secure jobs and, as a result, for far too many people work does not pay.
<01> The innovation, dynamism and sheer hard work of British business and workers has never been in question. The next Labour government will partner with them to kickstart economic growth and rebuild Britain.
<01> “Labour’s plan for the economy is good news for my customers and colleagues in high streets across the country. Labour will bring stability, good jobs and higher living standards. As a business leader, I am sick and tired of chaos under the Conservatives. I am absolutely convinced that Keir Starmer is the leader to deliver the change this country needs. Labour will end division, strengthen our communities and protect the environment. That’s why I’ll be voting Labour and I urge you to do the same.”
<01> – Richard Walker OBE, Executive Chairman of Iceland
<01> Strategic partnership through industrial strategy
<01> Labour will introduce a new industrial strategy. Our approach will be mission-driven and focused on the future. We will work in partnership with industry to seize opportunities and remove barriers to growth. Critically, we will end short-term economic policy making with the establishment of an Industrial Strategy Council, on a statutory footing, to provide expert advice. We will ensure representation on the Council from all nations and regions, business and trade unions, to drive economic growth in all parts of the country.
<01> Labour will take a sectoral approach and be clear-eyed about where the UK enjoys advantages over other countries. Our approach will back what makes Britain great: our excellent research institutions, professional services, advanced manufacturing, and creative industries. We will ensure a pro-business environment, with a competition and regulatory framework, that supports innovation, investment, and high-quality jobs. Procurement and trade policy will also be aligned with our industrial strategy priorities.
<01> Financial services are one of Britain’s greatest success stories. Labour will create the conditions to support innovation and growth in the sector, through supporting new technology, including Open Banking and Open Finance and ensuring a pro-innovation regulatory framework.
<01> Our other great British industries need certainty over the policies that will apply to them. In opposition, Labour has worked with the automotive, life sciences, and creative sectors, on the approach we will take to policy. In government, we will set out plans for these and other vital sectors of the economy.
<01> Boosting investment
<01> Business has for too long been hampered by a government that does not work with it. As a result, investment in the UK is too low. To address this long-standing problem Labour will use every available lever. Public investment, where it supports and de-risks additional private investment, is one important tool being used successfully across the world. It can create good jobs across the country and would mean British taxpayers can reap the benefits of economic growth. To realise these opportunities Labour will establish a National Wealth Fund.
<01> Capitalised with £7.3 billion over the course of the next Parliament, the National Wealth Fund will have a remit to support Labour’s growth and clean energy missions, making transformative investments across every part of the country. The fund will have a target of attracting three pounds of private investment for every one pound of public investment, creating jobs across the country. We plan to allocate:
<01> £1.8 billion to upgrade ports and build supply chains across the UK
<01> £1.5 billion to new gigafactories so our automotive industry leads the world
<01> £2.5 billion to rebuild our steel industry
<01> £1 billion to accelerate the deployment of carbon capture
<01> £500 million to support the manufacturing of green hydrogen.
<01> Labour will also act to increase investment from pension funds in UK markets. We will adopt reforms to ensure that workplace pension schemes take advantage of consolidation and scale, to deliver better returns for UK savers and greater productive investment for UK PLC. We will also undertake a review of the pensions landscape to consider what further steps are needed to improve pension outcomes and increase investment in UK markets.
<01> Labour’s first steps for change: delivering economic stability
<01> Business taxation
<01> The business tax regime matters for investors. It is not just the rates of tax that matter, but also certainty. Under the Conservatives there has been constant chopping and changing – corporation tax has changed 26 times – and multiple fiscal events have made drastic changes often at little notice.
<01> Labour will stop the chaos, and turn the page with a strategic approach that gives certainty and allows long-term planning. We are committed to one major fiscal event a year, giving families and businesses due warning of tax and spending policies. We will publish a roadmap for business taxation for the next parliament which will allow businesses to plan investments with confidence.
<01> Labour will cap corporation tax at the current level of 25 per cent, the lowest in the G7, for the entire parliament, and we will act if tax changes in other countries pose a risk to UK competitiveness. We will retain a permanent full expensing system for capital investment and the annual investment allowance for small business. And we will give firms greater clarity on what qualifies for allowances to improve business investment decisions.
<01> The current business rates system disincentivises investment, creates uncertainty and places an undue burden on our high streets. In England, Labour will replace the business rates system, so we can raise the same revenue but in a fairer way. This new system will level the playing field between the high street and online giants, better incentivise investment, tackle empty properties and support entrepreneurship.
<01> Economic infrastructure
<01> Britain is grinding to a halt. Rail cancellations are at record levels, energy prices have risen faster here than in any other country in Western Europe, and not a single reservoir has been built in the last 30 years. This is not an accident. Conservative chaos has seen major projects abandoned, decades-long delays, cost overruns, uncertainty for supply chains, and our infrastructure crumbling.
<01> Labour will end this chaos by developing a ten-year infrastructure strategy, aligned with our industrial strategy and regional development priorities, including improving rail connectivity across the north of England. The strategy will guide investment plans and give the private sector certainty about the project pipeline. We will work closely with business to map and address the delivery challenges we face. We will create a new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority, bringing together existing bodies, to set strategic infrastructure priorities and oversee the design, scope, and delivery of projects.
<01> The current planning regime acts as a major brake on economic growth. Labour will make the changes we need to forge ahead with new roads, railways, reservoirs, and other nationally significant infrastructure. We will set out new national policy statements, make major projects faster and cheaper by slashing red tape, and build support for developments by ensuring communities directly benefit. We will also update national planning policy to ensure the planning system meets the needs of a modern economy, making it easier to build laboratories, digital infrastructure, and gigafactories. Labour will ensure economic regulation supports growth and investment, promotes competition, works for consumers, and enables innovation.
<01> In an ever more connected world, Britain’s communication network is also vital. Under the Conservatives, investment in 5G is falling behind other countries and the rollout of gigabit broadband has been slow. Labour will make a renewed push to fulfil the ambition of full gigabit and national 5G coverage by 2030.
<01> Royal Mail remains a key part of the UK’s infrastructure. Labour will ensure that any proposed takeover is robustly scrutinised and that appropriate guarantees are forthcoming that protect the interests of the workforce, customers and the United Kingdom, including the need to maintain a comprehensive universal service obligation.
<01> Labour will also explore new business and governance models for Royal Mail so that workers and customers who rely on Royal Mail services can have a stronger voice in the governance and strategic direction of the company.

<01> A modern transport network
<01> Rebuilding Britain means modernising our transport infrastructure. Our road network is plagued by long-promised projects that are never delivered. The potholes cratering our roads are a visible sign of the decline after 14 years of Conservative rule.
<01> Cars remain by far the most popular form of transport. Labour will maintain and renew our road network, to ensure it serves drivers, cyclists and other road users, remains safe, and tackles congestion. We will fix an additional one million potholes across England in each year of the next parliament, funded by deferring the A27 bypass, which is poor value for money. Labour will further support drivers by tackling the soaring cost of car insurance. And, as set out in our automotive sector plan, Labour will support the transition to electric vehicles by accelerating the roll out of charge points, giving certainty to manufacturers by restoring the phase-out date of 2030 for new cars with internal combustion engines, and supporting buyers of second-hand electric cars by standardising the information supplied on the condition of batteries.
<01> Labour will overhaul Britain’s railways. Fourteen years of Conservative neglect have failed passengers, businesses and taxpayers. We will put passengers at the heart of the service by reforming the railways and bringing them into public ownership. We will do this as contracts with existing operators expire or are broken through a failure to deliver, without costing taxpayers a penny in compensation. Great British Railways will deliver a unified system that focuses on reliable, affordable, high-quality, and efficient services; along with ensuring safety and accessibility. It will be responsible for investment, day-to-day operational delivery and innovations and improvements for passengers, working with publicly-owned rail operators in Wales and Scotland. Mayors will have a role in designing the services in their areas. There will be a duty to promote and grow the use of rail freight. Open access operators are an important part of the rail system and will have an ongoing role. Labour will also create a tough new passenger watchdog, focused on driving up standards.
<01> Local communities have lost control over their bus routes. Fares have increased, routes have disappeared, and services are unreliable. Building on the work of Labour mayors, we will reform the broken system through new powers for local leaders to franchise local bus services, and we will lift the ban on municipal ownership. This will give local communities in England control over routes and schedules.
<01> Under the Conservatives, transport services have remained fragmented and inefficient with companies and sectors failing to speak to and plan with each other. Labour will give mayors the power to create unified and integrated transport systems, allowing for more seamless journeys, and to promote active travel networks. Labour will also develop a long-term strategy for transport, ensuring transport infrastructure can be delivered efficiently and on time. Labour will secure the UK aviation industry’s long-term future, including through promoting sustainable aviation fuels, and encouraging airspace modernisation.
<01> Driving innovation
<01> Delivering growth and raising productivity depend on fresh thinking and new ideas. Britain has many cutting-edge businesses, but innovation needs to be converted into commercial success in every corner of our country. Labour will make Britain the best place to start and grow a business.
<01> We will ensure our industrial strategy supports the development of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector, removes planning barriers to new datacentres. And we will create a National Data Library to bring together existing research programmes and help deliver data-driven public services, whilst maintaining strong safeguards and ensuring all of the public benefit.
<01> Labour will scrap short funding cycles for key R&D institutions in favour of ten-year budgets that allow meaningful partnerships with industry to keep the UK at the forefront of global innovation. We will work with universities to support spinouts; and work with industry to ensure start-ups have the access to finance they need to grow. We will also simplify the procurement process to support innovation and reduce micromanagement with a mission-driven approach.
<01> Regulators are currently ill-equipped to deal with the dramatic development of new technologies, which often cut across traditional industries and sectors. Labour will create a new Regulatory Innovation Office, bringing together existing functions across government. This office will help regulators update regulation, speed up approval timelines, and co-ordinate issues that span existing boundaries. Labour will ensure the safe development and use of AI models by introducing binding regulation on the handful of companies developing the most powerful AI models and by banning the creation of sexually explicit deepfakes.
<01> Labour will support diverse business models which bring innovation and new products to the market. This includes the co-operative sector, and we will aim to double the size of the UK’s co-operative and mutuals sector. We will work with the sector to address the barriers they face, such as accessing finance.
<01> Support for small business and the self-employed
<01> Labour’s plan for economic growth has been developed for all UK businesses. But small firms, entrepreneurs, and the self- employed face unique challenges. That is why, in partnership, Labour has developed a plan for small businesses – the lifeblood of communities and high streets across the country.
<01> We will take action on late payments to ensure small businesses and the self-employed are paid on time. We will improve guidance and remove barriers to exporting for small businesses. Reform of the British Business Bank, including a stronger mandate to support growth in the regions and nations, will make it easier for small and medium sized enterprises to access capital. We will also reform procurement rules to give them greater access to government contracts.
<01> The Post Office is an essential service in communities across the country. Labour will look for ways to strengthen the Post Office network, in consultation with sub-postmasters, trade unions and customers, and support the development of new products, services and business models, such as banking hubs, that will help reinvigorate the high street. We will also ensure justice and compensation are delivered swiftly for those sub-postmasters shamefully affected by the Horizon IT scandal.
<01> Get Britain building again
<01> The dream of homeownership is now out of reach for too many young people. The Conservatives have failed to act even though the housing crisis is well known to be one of the country’s biggest barriers to growth. Labour will get Britain building again, creating jobs across England, with 1.5 million new homes over the next parliament.
<01> We will immediately update the National Policy Planning Framework to undo damaging Conservative changes, including restoring mandatory housing targets. We will take tough action to ensure that planning authorities have up-to-date Local Plans and reform and strengthen the presumption in favour of sustainable development. Labour will support local authorities by funding additional planning officers, through increasing the rate of the stamp duty surcharge paid by non-UK residents. We will ensure local communities continue to shape housebuilding in their area, but where necessary Labour will not be afraid to make full use of intervention powers to build the houses we need.
<01> Labour will take a brownfield first approach, prioritising the development of previously used land wherever possible, and fast-tracking approval of urban brownfield sites. But brownfield development alone will not be enough to meet our housing need.
<01> Labour is committed to preserving the green belt which has served England’s towns and cities well over many decades. Under the Conservatives, greenbelt land is regularly released for development but haphazardly and often for speculative housebuilding. Without changing its purpose or general extent, Labour will take a more strategic approach to greenbelt land designation and release to build more homes in the right places. The release of lower quality ‘grey belt’ land will be prioritised and we will introduce ‘golden rules’ to ensure development benefits communities and nature.
<01> In partnership with local leaders and communities, a Labour government will build a new generation of new towns, inspired by the proud legacy of the 1945 Labour government. Alongside urban extensions and regeneration projects, these will form part of a series of large-scale new communities across England.
<01> Housing need in England cannot be met without planning for growth on a larger than local scale so we will introduce effective new mechanisms for cross-boundary strategic planning. Labour will require all Combined and Mayoral Authorities to strategically plan for housing growth in their areas. We will give Combined Authorities new planning powers along with new freedoms and flexibilities to make better use of grant funding.
<01> Labour will further reform compulsory purchase compensation rules to improve land assembly, speed up site delivery, and deliver housing, infrastructure, amenity, and transport benefits in the public interest. We will take steps to ensure that for specific types of development schemes, landowners are awarded fair compensation rather than inflated prices based on the prospect of planning permission.
<01> Labour will deliver the biggest increase in social and affordable housebuilding in a generation. We will strengthen planning obligations to ensure new developments provide more affordable homes; make changes to the Affordable Homes Programme to ensure that it delivers more homes from existing funding; and support councils and housing associations to build their capacity and make a greater contribution to affordable housing supply. Labour will prioritise the building of new social rented homes and better protect our existing stock by reviewing the increased right to buy discounts introduced in 2012 and increasing protections on newly-built social housing.
<01> Labour wants exemplary development to be the norm not the exception. We will take steps to ensure we are building more high-quality, well-designed, and sustainable homes and creating places that increase climate resilience and promote nature recovery. We will implement solutions to unlock the building of homes affected by nutrient neutrality without weakening environmental protections.
<01> Labour will work with local authorities to give first-time buyers the first chance to buy homes and end the farce of entire developments being sold off to international investors before houses are even built. And we will introduce a permanent, comprehensive mortgage guarantee scheme, to support first-time buyers who struggle to save for a large deposit, with lower mortgage costs.
<01> Economic growth across the country
<01> Every town and city across the country has a vital contribution to make to our economy. But too many areas have been held back because decisions are often taken in Westminster, and not by local leaders who understand local ambitions and strengths. This means we fail to make the most of the contribution everyone can make, hampering economic growth. So, Labour will transfer power out of Westminster, and into our communities, with landmark devolution legislation to take back control.
<01> In England, Labour will deepen devolution settlements for existing Combined Authorities. We will also widen devolution to more areas, encouraging local authorities to come together and take on new powers. Towns and cities will be able to take hold of the tools they need to pursue growth, create jobs, and improve living standards. Local areas will be able to gain new powers over transport, adult education and skills, housing and planning, and employment support. We will ensure those places have the strong governance arrangements, capacity, and capability to deliver, providing central support where needed.
<01> At the centre of our approach is a new statutory requirement for Local Growth Plans that cover towns and cities across the country. Local leaders will work with major employers, universities, colleges, and industry bodies to produce long-term plans that identify growth sectors and put in place the programmes and infrastructure they need to thrive. These will align with our national industrial strategy.
<01> Labour will review the governance arrangements for Combined Authorities to unblock decision making. We will provide greater flexibility with integrated settlements for Mayoral Combined Authorities that can show exemplary management of public money. On housing and planning we will seek to consolidate powers to allow for improved decision making.
<01> Our approach will require partnership with local authorities. Local government is facing acute financial challenges because of the Conservatives’ economic mismanagement which sent interest rates soaring, along with their failures on public services. To provide greater stability, a Labour government will give councils multi-year funding settlements and end wasteful competitive bidding. We recognise good jobs deliver better services that local communities can rely on. Labour will provide capacity and support to councils, and will overhaul the local audit system, so taxpayers get better value for money.
<01> Improving public services is essential to growing our economy across the country. Public service workers have a critical role to play, but services are suffering from recruitment and retention crises. Labour will act to improve public service workers’ living standards throughout the parliament, and ensure any independent mechanisms have the confidence of all involved.
<01> Labour will also work with the Scottish and Welsh Governments, and the Northern Ireland Executive, to drive growth across the country. Our industrial strategy will support successful industries across all nations of the UK.
<01> A fair and properly managed immigration system
<01> People who have come to the UK to work make a substantial contribution to our economy, our public services, and our communities.
<01> But under the Conservatives, our economy has become overly dependent on workers from abroad to fill skills shortages. As a result, we have seen net migration reach record highs; more than triple the level than at the last election in 2019. The overall level must be properly controlled and managed. Failure to do so reduces the incentives for businesses to train locally. So, Labour will reduce net migration.
<01> We will reform the points-based immigration system so that it is fair and properly managed, with appropriate restrictions on visas, and by linking immigration and skills policy. Labour will not tolerate employers or recruitment agencies abusing the visa system. And we will not stand for breaches of employment law. Employers who flout the rules will be barred from hiring workers from abroad.
<01> Conservative policy is incoherent, with decisions on migration, skills and sectoral pay determined in isolation. Labour will bring joined-up thinking, ensuring that migration to address skills shortages triggers a plan to upskill workers and improve working conditions in the UK. We will strengthen the Migration Advisory Committee, and establish a framework for joint working with skills bodies across the UK, the Industrial Strategy Council and the Department for Work and Pensions. We will end the long-term reliance on overseas workers in some parts of the economy by bringing in workforce and training plans for sectors such as health and social care, and construction.
<01> The days of a sector languishing endlessly on immigration shortage lists with no action to train up workers will come to an end.
<01> Supporting people into work
<01> Too many people are out of work or not earning enough. Long waits for treatment of health conditions, particularly mental health, are contributing to the rise in economic inactivity. Labour will reform employment support so it drives growth and opportunity. Our system will be underpinned by rights and responsibilities – people who can work, should work – and there will be consequences for those who do not fulfil their obligations.
<01> We will bring Jobcentre Plus and the National Careers Service together to provide a national jobs and careers service, focused on getting people into work and helping them get on at work. We will ensure the service is responsive to local employers, inclusive for all users, and works in partnership with other local services.
<01> Labour will work with local areas to create plans to support more disabled people and those with health conditions into work. We will devolve funding so local areas can shape a joined-up work, health, and skills offer for local people. We will tackle the backlog of Access to Work claims and give disabled people the confidence to start working without the fear of an immediate benefit reassessment if it does not work out. We believe the Work Capability Assessment is not working and needs to be reformed or replaced, alongside a proper plan to support disabled people to work.
<01> One in eight young people are not in education, employment, or training, with those lacking good qualifications and with poor mental health facing particular disadvantages. Drawing together existing funding and entitlements, Labour will establish a youth guarantee of access to training, an apprenticeship, or support to find work for all 18- to 21-year-olds, to bring down the number of young people who are not learning or earning. We will also guarantee two weeks’ worth of work experience for every young person, and improve careers advice in schools and colleges.
<01> We will work with the Scottish and Welsh Governments, and Mayors and Combined Authorities in England, to ensure all aspects of our new approach to Jobcentre Plus and employment support partner effectively with devolved provision, to offer the best opportunities for people right across the country.
<01> Making work pay
<01> Greater in-work security, better pay, and more autonomy in the workplace improve the lives of working people and bring substantial economic benefits. Britain’s outdated employment laws are not fit for the modern economy, and recent Conservative legislation has fuelled hostility and confrontation leading to the worst period in industrial relations since the 1980s.
<01> For too many people a job does not offer the route out of poverty it should: either because work is insecure, inflexible, or low paid; or because people face barriers when trying to move into a better job. Responsible businesses face being undercut when rights are not enforced properly.
<01> Labour will stop the chaos and turn the page to create a partnership between business and trade unions, by implementing ‘Labour’s Plan to Make Work Pay: Delivering a New Deal for Working People’ in full – introducing legislation within 100 days. We will consult fully with businesses, workers, and civil society on how to put our plans into practice before legislation is passed. This will include banning exploitative zero hours contracts; ending fire and rehire; and introducing basic rights from day one to parental leave, sick pay, and protection from unfair dismissal. We will strengthen the collective voice of workers, including through their trade unions, and create a Single Enforcement Body to ensure employment rights are upheld. These changes will improve the lives of working people across the entire UK.
<01> Labour will also make sure the minimum wage is a genuine living wage. We will change the remit of the independent Low Pay Commission so for the first time it accounts for the cost of living. Labour will also remove the discriminatory age bands, so all adults are entitled to the same minimum wage, delivering a pay rise to hundreds of thousands of workers across the UK.
<01> Labour will stop the chaos, turn the page, and kickstart economic growth by reforming our economy.
<01> Help deliver change to Britain.
<01> Make Britain a clean energy superpower
<01> How Labour will make Britain a clean energy superpower:
<01> Set up Great British Energy to cut bills for good
<01> Energy independence from dictators like Putin
<01> 650,000 new high-quality jobs
<01> Warmer homes to slash fuel poverty
<01> Water companies forced to clean up our rivers
<01> The climate and nature crisis is the greatest long-term global challenge that we face. The clean energy transition represents a huge opportunity to generate growth, tackle the cost-of-living crisis and make Britain energy independent once again. That is why clean energy by 2030 is Labour’s second mission.
<01> The Conservatives have failed to grasp opportunities in this area for two related reasons. First, because they simply do not accept that economic growth, energy security, lower bills, and addressing climate change can be complementary. Second, because they are ideologically opposed to using the role of the state, including public investment, to guarantee that they are.
<01> The damage done by 14 years of chaotic ‘sticking plaster’ policies was exposed when Putin invaded Ukraine. The cost of fossil fuel energy on the international market rocketed. The Conservatives’ ban on new onshore wind, failure to build new nuclear power stations, and decision to scrap investment in home insulation landed British families with amongst the highest energy bills in Europe. That is just one way we are paying the price. While countries around the world are racing ahead to claim the jobs and wealth that the transition offers, Britain is losing out.
<01> But it is not too late to stop the chaos and turn the page.
<01> We have tremendous untapped advantages: our long coast- line, high winds, shallow waters, universities, and skilled offshore workforce combined with our extensive technological and engineering capabilities. With a serious industrial strategy and a genuine partnership between the public and private sectors, we can make Britain a clean energy superpower.
<01> Labour will take decisive action to seize this economic opportunity. We will shape markets, and use public investment to crowd in private funding. At the heart of our approach will be our Green Prosperity Plan where, in partnership with business through our National Wealth Fund, we will invest in the industries of the future. Our plan will create 650,000 jobs across the country by 2030.
<01> We will end the chaotic Conservative chopping and changing on policy, harness clean power to boost our energy security, and invest in home insulation upgrades. We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good.
<01> We will provide leadership at home so we can influence others to ensure every country plays their part in meeting our collective obligations to future generations.
<01> At home we will also tackle the Conservatives’ nature emergency, including the unforgivable pollution of our rivers and seas. We will improve access to nature, promote biodiversity, and protect our landscapes and wildlife.
<01> Labour understands the road ahead. We have been clear that this transition presents an opportunity to create good jobs, with no community left behind, and support well-paying jobs in existing and future industries. The Conservatives propose an alternative course. A denial of reality; delaying action; increasing costs for Britain; exposing us to insecurity; and a failure to win the jobs of the future. They tried this chaotic approach in the 1970s and 80s, and communities are still scarred by what happened. That is the choice facing Britain.
<01> “A national mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and should be prioritised. We desperately need to end the era of high energy bills, excessive carbon emissions and energy insecurity by accelerating the transition to clean, homegrown energy. Britain can lead on this by treating this mission like the vaccine challenge. We can be the innovators and the implementers, helping ourselves and exporting our solutions worldwide. But if we choose to go slowly, others will provide the answers, and ultimately we’ll end up buying these solutions rather than selling them.”
<01> – Sir Patrick Vallance, Former Chief Scientific Adviser
<01> Clean power by 2030
<01> Families and businesses will have lower bills for good, from a zero-carbon electricity system. We have chosen this mission not because it is easy, but because working people can never again be left vulnerable to dictators like Putin.
<01> To deliver our clean power mission, Labour will work with the private sector to double onshore wind, triple solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. We will invest in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and marine energy, and ensure we have the long-term energy storage our country needs. A new Energy Independence Act will establish the framework for Labour’s energy and climate policies.
<01> Labour will end a decade of dithering that has seen the Conservatives duck decisions on nuclear power. We will ensure the long-term security of the sector, extending the lifetime of existing plants, and we will get Hinkley Point C over the line. New nuclear power stations, such as Sizewell C, and Small Modular Reactors, will play an important role in helping the UK achieve energy security and clean power while securing thousands of good, skilled jobs.
<01> Labour will maintain a strategic reserve of gas power stations to guarantee security of supply. We will ensure a phased and responsible transition in the North Sea that recognises the proud history of our offshore industry and the brilliance of its workforce, particularly in Scotland and the North East of England, and the ongoing role of oil and gas in our energy mix.
<01> We will embrace the future of energy production and storage which will make use of existing offshore infrastructure and the skills of our offshore workforce. Labour will not revoke existing licences and we will partner with business and workers to manage our existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan. Crucially, oil and gas production in the North Sea will be with us for decades to come, and the North Sea will be managed in a way that does not jeopardise jobs. And our offshore workers will lead the world in the industries of the future.
<01> We will not issue new licences to explore new fields because they will not take a penny off bills, cannot make us energy secure, and will only accelerate the worsening climate crisis. In addition, we will not grant new coal licences and will ban fracking for good.
<01> To support investment in this plan, Labour will close the loopholes in the windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Companies have benefitted from enormous profits not because of their ingenuity or investment, but because of an energy shock which raised prices for British families. Labour will therefore extend the sunset clause in the Energy Profits Levy until the end of the next parliament. We will also increase the rate of the levy by three percentage points, as well as removing the unjustifiably generous investment allowances. Labour will also retain the Energy Security Investment Mechanism.
<01> Switch on Great British Energy
<01> To drive forward investment in clean, home-grown energy production, Labour will create a new publicly-owned company, Great British Energy. It will be owned by the British people and deliver power back to the British people.
<01> Great British Energy will partner with industry and trade unions to deliver clean power by co-investing in leading technologies; will help support capital-intensive projects; and will deploy local energy production to benefit communities across the country. To support this, Labour will capitalise Great British Energy with £8.3 billion, over the next parliament.
<01> The company will create jobs and build supply chains in every corner of the UK. Scotland will be the powerhouse of our clean energy mission, with Great British Energy headquartered there.
<01> Local power generation is an essential part of the energy mix and reduces pressures on the transmission grid. Labour will deploy more distributed production capacity through our Local Power Plan. Great British Energy will partner with energy companies, local authorities, and co-operatives to install thousands of clean power projects, through a combination of onshore wind, solar, and hydropower projects. We will invite communities to come forward with projects, and work with local leaders and devolved governments to ensure local people benefit directly from this energy production.
<01> “I’ve never struggled this much to keep warm”
<01> Gary, pensioner
<01> Energy system reform
<01> Under the Conservatives, the broken energy market has let customers down. The government has allowed scandalous abuses on their watch, including poor customer service, companies going to the wall with the costs falling on billpayers, and the mass forced installation of pre-payment meters.
<01> Labour will ensure a much tougher system of regulation that puts consumers first and attracts the investment needed to cut bills. Too much of the burden of the bill is on standing charges and we will work with the regulator to reduce them. We will strengthen the regulator to ensure it can hold companies to account for wrongdoing, require higher standards of performance, and ensure there is automatic customer compensation for failure.
<01> The national grid has become the single biggest obstacle to the deployment of cheap, clean power generation and the electrification of industry. With grid connection dates not being offered until the late 2030s, important business and infrastructure investment is being stalled or lost overseas. Labour will work with industry to upgrade our national transmission infrastructure and rewire Britain.
<01> High-quality jobs
<01> As Britain becomes a clean energy superpower, Labour is determined that we will create new high-quality jobs, working with business and trade unions, as we manage the transition. We will rebuild supply chains at home. And, as the first major economy to transition to a clean-energy system, we will export the technologies of the future.
<01> Labour’s National Wealth Fund will directly invest in ports, hydrogen and industrial clusters in every corner of the country. We will also secure the future of Britain’s automotive and steel industries.
<01> We will reward clean energy developers with a British Jobs Bonus, allocating up to £500 million per year from 2026, to incentivise firms who offer good jobs, terms and conditions and build their manufacturing supply chains in our industrial heartlands, coastal areas, and energy communities.
<01> Labour will end the injustice of the Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme. We will review the unfair surplus arrangements and transfer the Investment Reserve Fund back to members, so that the mineworkers who powered our country receive a fairer pension.
<01> Warm homes plan
<01> The energy shock of recent years has highlighted the urgent importance of improving energy efficiency in British homes. Labour will invest an extra £6.6 billion over the next parliament, doubling the existing planned government investment, to upgrade five million homes to cut bills for families.
<01> The Warm Homes Plan will offer grants and low interest loans to support investment in insulation and other improvements such as solar panels, batteries and low carbon heating to cut bills. We will partner with combined authorities, local and devolved governments, to roll out this plan. Labour will also work with the private sector, including banks and building societies, to provide further private finance to accelerate home upgrades and low carbon heating. We will ensure homes in the private rented sector meet minimum energy efficiency standards by 2030, saving renters hundreds of pounds per year. Nobody will be forced to rip out their boiler as a result of our plans.
<01> Labour will save families hundreds of pounds, slash fuel poverty, and get Britain back on track to meet our climate targets. Our plan will mean good skilled jobs for tradespeople in every part of the country.
<01> Accelerating to net zero
<01> British industry is also held back by high electricity costs, which has often made investing here uncompetitive. Labour’s clean energy mission will drive down those bills, making British businesses internationally competitive while our National Wealth Fund supports the most energy intensive sectors to decarbonise.
<01> Labour supports the introduction of a carbon border adjustment mechanism. This will protect British industries as we decarbonise, prevent countries from dumping lower-quality goods into British markets, and support the UK to meet our climate objectives.
<01> Labour will ensure the institutional framework for policy making reflects our commitments to reach net zero and meet our carbon budgets. The Conservatives’ decision to prevent the Bank of England giving due consideration to climate change in its mandates will be reversed.
<01> Britain’s world-leading financial services industry has a major role to play in mobilising trillions of pounds in private capital to address the greatest long-term challenge of our age. Labour will make the UK the green finance capital of the world, mandating UK-regulated financial institutions – including banks, asset managers, pension funds, and insurers – and FTSE 100 companies to develop and implement credible transition plans that align with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement.
<01> Improving resilience
<01> Preparing for the future not only means tackling the climate and nature emergencies, but also adapting to the changes they will bring to our environment. Without action, flooding and coastal erosion will pose greater risks to lives, livelihoods and people’s wellbeing. The Conservatives’ poor risk management, and a disjointed approach across government and regulators have left Britain badly exposed.
<01> Labour will improve resilience and preparation across central government, local authorities, local communities, and emergency services. This includes formally working with all stakeholders in the Fire and Rescue services to inform policy and establish national standards.
<01> Protecting nature
<01> The climate crisis has accelerated the nature crisis. Whilst Britain enjoys remarkable natural beauty, the Conservatives have left Britain one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. Labour will deliver for nature, taking action to meet our Environment Act targets, and will work in partnership with civil society, communities and business to restore and protect our natural world.
<01> As part of our plans to improve responsible access to nature, Labour will create nine new National River Walks, one in each region of England, and establish three new National Forests in England, whilst planting millions of trees and creating new woodlands. Labour will expand nature-rich habitats such as wetlands, peat bogs and forests so families can explore and wildlife can thrive, including on public land. Labour is committed to reducing waste by moving to a circular economy.
<01> Clean water
<01> Britain’s coasts, rivers, and lakes are being polluted by illegal sewage dumping. The Conservatives have turned a blind eye and weakened rather than strengthened regulation, with serious damage being done to our countryside, our tourism industry, and people’s health.
<01> Labour will put failing water companies under special measures to clean up our water. We will give regulators new powers to block the payment of bonuses to executives who pollute our waterways and bring criminal charges against persistent law breakers. We will impose automatic and severe fines for wrongdoing and ensure independent monitoring of every outlet.
<01> Supporting British farmers
<01> Labour recognises that food security is national security. That is why we will champion British farming whilst protecting the environment. We will set a target for half of all food purchased across the public sector to be locally produced or certified to higher environmental standards. We will introduce a land-use framework and make environment land management schemes work for farmers and nature. And we will work with farmers and scientists on measures to eradicate Bovine TB, protecting livelihoods, so that we can end the ineffective badger cull.
<01> Stronger animal welfare
<01> Labour will improve animal welfare. We will ban trail hunting and the import of hunting trophies. We will end puppy smuggling and farming, along with the use of snare traps. And we will partner with scientists, industry, and civil society as we work towards the phasing out of animal testing.
<01> Labour will end the climate and energy chaos, turn the page on 14 years of failed policies, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.
<01> Help deliver change to Britain.
<01> Take back our streets
<01> How Labour will take back our streets:
<01> Crack down on antisocial behaviour with more neighbourhood police
<01> Tough new penalties for offenders
<01> A plan to get knives off our streets
<01> A specialist rape unit in every police force
<01> A new network of Young Futures hubs
<01> Labour has a straightforward vision for policing and criminal justice.
<01> When you call the police, they should come. When you report a crime, it should be properly investigated no matter who you are, or where you live. Police should have the trust of communities. Victims must have faith that justice will be delivered, and criminals will be punished. Prisons should not be academies of crime. These are not outlandish expectations. They are the basics of a safe, secure, law-abiding society.
<01> Sadly, this vision is a world away from Britain today. Our sense of security has been badly eroded. Serious violence is too high. Growing numbers of young people are drawn into gangs, drug dealing and violence at ever earlier ages. Antisocial behaviour blights our town and city centres. Fewer criminals are being caught and punished. More victims are being let down.
<01> This is not an accident, but the result of Conservative choices over the last 14 years. Community policing has been downgraded, with neighbourhood officers pulled off the beat to plug shortages elsewhere, weakening connections with communities they serve. Trust in the police has been undermined by failures in vetting and appalling misconduct of some officers. Powers to combat antisocial behaviour and shoplifting have been weakened, leaving our town centres exposed. Our justice system has been allowed to grind to a halt.
<01> This must change. Labour will restore neighbourhood policing with thousands of extra officers, and we will equip officers with the powers they need. We will tackle the epidemic of serious violence, with a greater focus on prevention, including by holding those companies and executives cashing in on knife crime personally to account. We will no longer tolerate the violence against women and girls that stains our society. And we will reform the justice system to put the needs of victims first, tackle the prisons crisis and cut reoffending.
<01> In short, Labour will stop the Conservative chaos and return law and order to our streets.
<01> Visible neighbourhood policing
<01> Visible neighbourhood policing was the cornerstone of the British consent-based model. In too many areas it has been eroded, leaving the police a reactive service focused on crisis response, rather than preventing crime.
<01> Labour will introduce a new Neighbourhood Policing Guarantee, restoring patrols to our town centres by recruiting thousands of new police officers, police and community support officers, and special constables. Communities and residents will have a named officer to turn to when things go wrong.
<01> These new recruits will be paid for by tackling waste through a new Police Efficiency and Collaboration programme for England and Wales. The programme will set nation-wide standards for procurement and establish shared services and specialist functions to drive down costs.
<01> Cracking down on antisocial behaviour
<01> Antisocial behaviour is not merely a ‘low-level’ nuisance. It hits the poorest communities hardest and, if left unchecked, leads to more serious offending. Yet, the Conservatives weakened enforcement powers. Labour will fix this by introducing new Respect Orders – powers to ban persistent adult offenders from town centres, which will stamp out issues such as public drinking and drug use. Fly-tippers and vandals will also be forced to clean up the mess they have created.
<01> With shoplifting soaring, retail workers increasingly find themselves in harm’s way. Labour will scrap the effective immunity for some shoplifting introduced by the Conservatives and create a new specific offence for assaults on shopworkers that will protect them from threats and violence.
<01> Knife crime action plan
<01> Knife crime has been rising for a decade, claiming far too many young lives. It is a national crisis, requiring urgent action. Yet, under the Conservatives, too often when a teenager is found with a knife, nothing happens, and carrying a knife becomes normalised. There are virtually no services for vulnerable teenagers at risk of being drawn into a life of violence. The next Labour government will change this. We aim to halve knife crime in a decade.
<01> Labour will end the practice of empty warnings by ensuring knife carrying triggers rapid intervention and tough consequences. Every young person caught in possession of a knife will be referred to a Youth Offending Team and will receive a mandatory plan to prevent reoffending, with penalties including curfews, tagging, and custody for the most serious cases.
<01> To get knives off our streets Labour will ban ninja swords, lethal zombie-style blades and machetes, and strengthen rules to prevent online sales. Executives of online companies that flout these rules will be personally held to account through tough sanctions.
<01> Labour will intervene earlier to stop young people being drawn into crime, creating a new Young Futures programme with a network of hubs reaching every community. These hubs will have youth workers, mental health support workers, and careers advisers on hand to support young people’s mental health and avoid them being drawn into crime.
<01> We will not wait for those at risk to come forward. Local prevention partnerships will identify young people who could be drawn into violence and intervene. And to offer young people a pathway out of violence, we will place youth workers and mentors in A&E units and Pupil Referral Units, funded by full recovery of the cost of firearm licensing.
<01> Labour will also introduce a new offence of criminal exploitation of children, to go after the gangs who are luring young people into violence and crime.
<01> “This was preventable. It’s the result of police cuts and the Conservatives serving themselves.”
<01> Nour: sister, aunt and campaigner for Raneem’s law
<01> Tackling violence against women and girls
<01> For too long, violence against women and girls has been ignored. Our landmark mission to halve violence against women and girls in a decade will require a national effort. We will use every government tool available to target perpetrators and address the root causes of abuse and violence.
<01> That starts with tougher enforcement and protection. With Labour, there will be specialist rape and sexual offences teams in every police force. The most prolific and harmful perpetrators will be relentlessly targeted, using tactics normally reserved for terrorists and organised crime.
<01> Prosecution rates for rape are shamefully low with many victims dropping out of the justice system when faced with years of delays. Labour will fast-track rape cases, with specialist courts at every Crown Court location in England and Wales.
<01> Victims deserve better support. Building on the success of the approach adopted by Labour Police and Crime Commissioners, we will introduce domestic abuse experts in 999 control rooms so that victims can talk directly to a specialist, and ensure there is a legal advocate in every police force area to advise victims from the moment of report to trial.
<01> Violence and abuse against women and girls does not come from nowhere. Misogyny is one root cause, and therefore Labour will ensure schools address misogyny and teach young people about healthy relationships and consent. We will ensure police forces have the powers they need to track and tackle the problem.
<01> Stalking has not been treated with the seriousness it deserves. Labour will strengthen the use of Stalking Protection Orders and give women the right to know the identity of online stalkers. Spiking is a devastating crime for victims, leaving many women feeling vulnerable when they go out. Labour will introduce a new criminal offence for spiking to help police better respond to this crime.
<01> We will strengthen the rights and protections available to women in co-habiting couples, as well as for whistleblowers in the workplace, including on sexual harassment.
<01> Better policing
<01> Under the Conservatives, poor policing performance has been tolerated, with forces spending years in special measures. Trust in the police has been undermined by the appalling acts of some officers. Labour will turn the page and raise standards by reforming the police.
<01> Labour will give His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire & Rescue Services new powers to intervene with failing forces. We will introduce mandatory professional standards on vetting, checks and misconduct for individual officers; and stronger training on racism and violence against women and girls. Anyone with a history of violence against women and girls will be barred from the service and we will introduce automatic suspensions if officers are investigated for domestic abuse and sexual offences. Particular care is required when investigating children. Labour will introduce new legal safeguards around strip-searching children and young people.
<01> Fraud accounts for almost two in five crimes, but the Conservatives have failed to respond to the scale of the challenge. Labour will introduce a new expanded fraud strategy to tackle the full range of threats, including online, public sector and serious fraud. We will work with technology companies to stop their platforms being exploited by fraudsters.
<01> Criminals never stop looking for new ways to target victims. Police must change the way they operate too, with technology and investigative techniques keeping pace with modern threats. We will work with national policing bodies and police staff to standardise approaches to procurement, IT, professional standards and training. And we will ensure the service is organised so as to enable investment in specialist capabilities, such as digital forensics, and to more effectively tackle cross-border issues such as serious organised crime.
<01> “Labour has serious and credible plans to take back our streets, with ambitious missions to halve serious violence – including knife crime – finally tackle the scrouge of violence against women and girls, and rebuild public confidence in policing by getting bobbies back on the beat. These plans will require us to do things differently and to work hard to offer better protection to our communities. But they can only happen if you vote for them.”
<01> – Gavin Thomas, Former Detective Chief Superintendent and Former President of the Police Superintendents Association
<01> Solving crime
<01> Under the Conservatives, plummeting charge and prosecution rates have emboldened criminals. Rather than working together, police and prosecutors often engage in a blame game, which lets down victims.
<01> Labour will reverse this, driving up the proportion of crimes solved by reducing barriers to bringing charges, cutting bureaucracy, and improving collaboration. We will make it easier for high-performing police forces to charge domestic abuse suspects to speed up the process.
<01> Labour recognises recruitment challenges, particularly for detectives, so we will roll out a direct entry scheme for detectives to boost investigation skills.
<01> A justice system that puts victims first
<01> After 14 years of neglect, the criminal justice system is broken. Victims wait months, sometimes years, for their case to come to trial, unable to move on with their lives. As an initial step to address the courts backlog, Labour will ensure more prosecutors are available by allowing Associate Prosecutors to work on appropriate cases.
<01> We will introduce new protections for victims of crime and persistent antisocial behaviour, by increasing the powers of the Victims’ Commissioner, and ensuring victims can access the information and support they need.
<01> Even when criminals are found guilty, the sentences they receive often do not make sense either to victims or the wider public. This is particularly worrying for offences against women and girls. Labour will carry out a review of sentencing to ensure it is brought up to date.
<01> Getting a grip of our prisons and reducing reoffending
<01> Prisons in England and Wales are in crisis. The Conservatives’ failure to build sufficient places has led to overcrowding and chaos. Judges are being advised to delay sentencing. Prisoners are being released early. And fewer dangerous criminals are locked up because of a lack of space.
<01> The Conservatives have failed to get prisons built. Labour recognises that prisons are of national importance and therefore will use all relevant powers to build the prisons so badly needed.
<01> As a result of overcrowding, our prisons are increasingly dangerous, plagued by drug use and violent disorder – putting prison officers in a dangerous position. Far from being places where offenders are punished and rehabilitated, prisons are a breeding ground for more crime. Prison leavers are more likely to reoffend if they do not have the tools to move away from crime, if they have nowhere to live and if they do not have a job on release.
<01> Labour will act to reduce reoffending. We will work with prisons to improve offenders’ access to purposeful activity, such as learning, and ensure they create pre-release plans for those leaving custody. We will support prisons to link up with local employers and the voluntary sector to get ex-offenders into work. The children of those who are imprisoned are at far greater risk of being drawn into crime than their peers. We will ensure that those young people are identified and offered support to break the cycle.
<01> After 14 years of chaotic reorganisations, the national probation service is struggling to keep the public safe. A lack of co-ordination between prisons, probation and other local services also means prison-leavers are not getting the right support, raising the risk that they go straight back to crime.
<01> In some areas of the country, we have seen Labour Mayors pioneering a more joined-up approach to reduce reoffending. In Greater Manchester, probation is linked up with housing and health services to ensure offenders leaving custody receive the support they need. Labour will conduct a strategic review of probation governance, including considering the benefits of devolved models.
<01> Historical injustices
<01> Under the Conservatives, too many victims of historical injustices have had insult added to injury by years of legal delays. Without justice and the truth, victims and their families cannot move forward. Labour will right this wrong, act on the findings of the Infected Blood Inquiry, and respond to the findings of the Grenfell Inquiry and the Covid-19 Inquiry, to ensure swift resolution.
<01> Labour will introduce a ‘Hillsborough Law’ which will place a legal duty of candour on public servants and authorities, and provide legal aid for victims of disasters or state-related deaths. We will ensure the victims of the appalling Windrush scandal have their voices heard and the compensation scheme is run effectively, with a new Windrush Commissioner. Labour will also ensure, through an investigation or inquiry, that the truth about the events at Orgreave comes to light.
<01> Labour will stop the chaos that lets too many criminals act with impunity, turn the page with stronger policing, and rebuild our criminal justice system.
<01> Help deliver change to Britain.
<01> Break down barriers to opportunity
<01> How Labour will break down barriers to opportunity:
<01> Recruit 6,500 new expert teachers in key subjects
<01> 3,000 new primary school-based nurseries
<01> Free breakfast clubs in every primary school
<01> A modern curriculum so young people are ready for work and life
<01> High-quality apprenticeships and specialist technical colleges
<01> Whoever you are, wherever you come from, Britain should be a country where hard work means you can get on in life. Under the Conservatives, this basic promise – that if you work hard, you will enjoy the rewards – has been broken. We are a country where who your parents are – and how much money they have – too often counts for more than your effort and enterprise. Too many people see success as something that happens to others. This is an appalling waste of talent as well as a huge injustice. So, breaking the pernicious link between background and success will be a defining mission for Labour.
<01> First, we must recognise that greater opportunity requires greater security. Tackling economic insecurity – at work, at home, in our communities and public services – is the golden thread that runs through all of Labour’s missions. On that secure foundation, we can build an education system that prepares our children for life, work, and the future.
<01> Our education system is struggling to cope after years of chronic mismanagement under the Conservatives. Childcare and early education are increasingly unaffordable and unavailable. Too many children arrive at primary school not ready to learn. Too many children are not even getting to school. Teachers are burnt out and leaving in droves. Fewer people are participating in apprenticeships and training. Higher education is in crisis. Meanwhile, too many of our young people leave school unprepared for the future.
<01> Labour will transform our education system so that young people get the opportunities they deserve. We will expand our childcare and early‐years system, drive up standards, modernise the school curriculum, reform assessment, and create higher-quality training and employment paths by empowering local communities to develop the skills people need. We will also put employers at the heart of our skills system.
<01> Every child should believe that success belongs to them. Education has so often been the spark that can light a fire within, transforming life chances. It is time to light that fire for the whole country.
<01> Family security
<01> The last Labour government lifted over half a million children and over a million pensioners out of poverty. That progress transformed life chances and ensured security in retirement. The next Labour government will build on that legacy of pursuing opportunity and social justice.
<01> Good work will be the foundation of our approach to tackling poverty and inequality. We will create more good jobs, reform employment support, and make work pay so that many more people benefit from the dignity and purpose of work.
<01> Labour is committed to reviewing Universal Credit so that it makes work pay and tackles poverty. We want to end mass dependence on emergency food parcels, which is a moral scar on our society.
<01> Child poverty has gone up by 700,000 under the Conservatives, with over four million children now growing up in a low-income family. Last year, a million children experienced destitution. This not only harms children’s lives now, it damages their future prospects, and holds back our economic potential as a country. Labour will develop an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty. We will work with the voluntary sector, faith organisations, trade unions, business, devolved and local government, and communities to bring about change.
<01> We will take initial steps to confront poverty by introducing free breakfast clubs in every primary school, protecting renters from arbitrary eviction, slashing fuel poverty, banning exploitative zero hours contracts, and improving support to help people get into good work.
<01> Our system of state, private, and workplace pensions provide the basis for security in retirement. Labour will retain the triple lock for the state pension. We will also adopt reforms to workplace pensions to deliver better outcomes for UK savers and pensioners. Our pensions review will consider what further steps are needed to improve security in retirement, as well as to increase productive investment in the UK economy.
<01> Security also means having a secure roof over your head. That is not the case for too many renting their homes privately. Labour will legislate where the Conservatives have failed, overhauling the regulation of the private rented sector. We will immediately abolish Section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions, prevent private renters being exploited and discriminated against, empower them to challenge unreasonable rent increases, and take steps to decisively raise standards, including extending ‘Awaab’s Law’ to the private sector.
<01> Labour will also take decisive action to improve building safety, including through regulation, to ensure we never again see a repeat of the Grenfell fire. We will review how to better protect leaseholders from costs and take steps to accelerate the pace of remediation across the country. We will put a renewed focus on ensuring those responsible for the building safety crisis pay to put it right.
<01> For far too many leaseholders, the reality of home ownership falls woefully short of the dream they were promised. Labour will act where the Conservatives have failed and finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end. We will enact the package of Law Commission proposals on leasehold enfranchisement, right to manage and commonhold. We will take further steps to ban new leasehold flats and ensure commonhold is the default tenure. We will tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent charges. We will act to bring the injustice of ‘fleecehold’ private housing estates and unfair maintenance costs to an end.
<01> The last Labour government made huge strides in ending homelessness. Under the Conservatives, that progress has been undone, with rough sleepers an all-too-common sight in our towns and cities, and a sharp rise in hidden homelessness. Building on the lessons of our past, Labour will develop a new cross-government strategy, working with Mayors and Councils across the country, to put Britain back on track to ending homelessness.
<01> Best start in life

<02> childcare
<02> Doubling free childcare for hardworking families
<02> Britain should be the best place in the world to raise a family.
<02> From improving standards in schools to creating new jobs and apprenticeships, the Conservatives have made it a priority to improve opportunities for young people across the country.
<02> And we’re not stopping there.
<02> Parents should never be forced to choose between work and childcare. So we want to make sure parents have the support they need to decide what’s best for their family.
<02> That’s why the Conservatives are backing working parents and expanding free childcare.
<02> If you vote to stick with the plan, Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will DOUBLE free childcare.
<02> This means parents will have access to 30 hours of free childcare from the time their kids are 9 months old to the time they start school.
<02> It’s good for our economy and good for families.
<02> You can make this happen. Vote Conservative on Thursday 4 July.
<02> The Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024
<02> Foreword
<02> We are restoring our economic stability after Covid and Ukraine. Inflation is down, real wages are up, growth has returned – and
<02> we are cutting taxes to give working people financial security. This did not happen by accident. The economy is turning a corner because we built strong economic foundations before the pandemic and we have stuck to our plan.
<02> We must stick to this plan and take bold action to secure the future of our nation and society. In the next decade, we’ll face challenges to our energy and national security from foreign conflicts; to our border from uncontrolled and illegal migration; to our economy from global shocks and to our society from those seeking to divide and disempower communities. Dealing with these challenges requires a clear plan and bold action.
<02> We have that plan and the courage to take the bold steps necessary to build a secure future for you and your family.
<02> A future where hard work and doing the right thing is always rewarded, not punished with higher taxes and hidden green levies, or discouraged with unconstrained welfare.
<02> A future where aspiration and opportunity are celebrated and young people always get the skills they need to succeed.
<02> A future where public services, like the NHS, serve citizens not vested interests, and every citizen upholds British values of decency, democracy and service.
<02> A future, where national, border, energy and food security are put first, not taken for granted, and immigration is never allowed to run out of control.
<02> A future where family is always supported and communities decide their own priorities, rather than having them imposed from above.
<02> A future where we can have pride – in ourselves, in our communities and in our country.
<02> There is only one way to secure that future – and that is to vote Conservative on 4 July.
<02> We must stick with the plan – a plan that has given four million more people the security and purpose of a job, cut taxes for 29 million working people, protected pensioners with the Triple Lock, delivered more than 2.5 million homes, recruited record numbers of police officers to cut crime by more than 50%, recruited record numbers of teachers to help our children become the best readers in the West, delivered the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War and got Brexit done.
<02> The alternative is we go back to square one. To a fragile economy under Labour driven
<02> by unfunded spending, higher taxes on working families and debt piling up for future generations to pay off. And where immigration, crime and defence are not taken seriously.
<02> On 4 July, choose lower immigration, lower taxes and protected pensions. Choose a secure future with the Conservatives.
<02> The Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2024
<02> Bold actions to deliver a secure future for our country and for your family
<02> To support working people and secure a stronger economy
<02> ❱ Cut tax for workers by taking another 2p off employee National Insurance so that we will have halved it from 12% at the beginning of this year to 6% by April 2027, a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000 – and the next step in our long- term ambition to end the double tax on work when financial conditions allow.
<02> ❱ Cut taxes to support the self-employed by abolishing the main rate of self-employed National Insurance entirely by the end of the Parliament.
<02> ❱ Cut tax for pensioners with the new Triple Lock Plus, guaranteeing that both the State Pension and the tax free allowance for pensioners always rise with the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5% – so the new State Pension doesn’t get dragged into income tax.
<02> ❱ Give working parents 30 hours of free childcare a week from when their child is nine months old to when they start school, saving eligible families an average of £6,900 per year.
<02> ❱ End the unfairness in Child Benefit by moving to a household system, so families don’t start losing Child Benefit until their combined income reaches £120,000 – saving the average family which benefits £1,500.
<02> ❱ Cut the cost of net zero for consumers by taking a more pragmatic approach, guaranteeing no new green levies or charges while accelerating the rollout of renewables.
<02> ❱ Seize the benefits of Brexit by signing further trade deals, speeding up infrastructure and unblocking 100,000 homes, cutting red tape for business, and creating new fishing opportunities.
<02> To provide young people with a secure future
<02> ❱ Give young people the skills and opportunities they deserve by introducing mandatory National Service for all school leavers at 18, with the choice between a competitive placement in the military or civic service roles.
<02> ❱ Fund 100,000 high-quality apprenticeships for young people, paid for by curbing the number of poor-quality university degrees that leave young people worse off.
<02> ❱ Protect children by requiring schools to ban the use of mobile phones during the school day and ensuring parents can see what their children are being taught, especially on sensitive matters like sex education.
<02> ❱ Transform 16-19 education by introducing the Advanced British Standard, enabling young people to receive a broader education and removing the artificial divide between academic and technical learning.
<02> To safeguard our borders and national security
<02> ❱ Boost defence spending to our new NATO standard of 2.5% of GDP by 2030, so we can protect British interests at home and abroad in an increasingly hostile world.
<02> ❱ Introduce a legal cap on migration to guarantee that numbers will fall every year, so public services are protected while bringing in the skills our businesses and NHS needs.
<02> ❱ Stop the boats by removing illegal migrants to Rwanda.
<02> ❱ Work with other countries to rewrite asylum treaties to make them fit for the challenges we face.
<02> To strengthen our communities
<02> ❱ Increase NHS spending above inflation every year, recruiting 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors, driving up productivity in the NHS and moving care closer to people’s homes through Pharmacy First, new and modernised GP surgeries and more Community Diagnostic Centres.
<02> ❱ Protect female-only spaces and competitiveness in sport by making clear that sex means biological sex in the Equality Act.
<02> ❱ Deliver 1.6 million well-designed homes in the right places while protecting our countryside, permanently abolish Stamp Duty for homes up to £425,000 for first time buyers and introduce a new Help to Buy scheme.
<02> ❱ Recruit 8,000 more full-time, fully warranted police officers to ensure a new police officer for every neighbourhood.
<02> ❱ Cut anti-social behaviour in town centres by rolling out Hotspot Policing, expanding community payback and legislating to evict social tenants who repeatedly disrupt their neighbours.
<02> ❱ Invest £36 billion in local roads, rail and buses to drive regional growth, including £8.3 billion to fill potholes and resurface roads, funded by cancelling the second phase of HS2.
<02> ❱ Back drivers by stopping road pricing, reversing the London Mayor’s ULEZ expansion and applying local referendums to new 20mph zones and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods.
<02> ❱ Champion our rural communities by backing farmers with a legal target and additional investment for food security, and protecting our best agricultural land from solar farms.
<02> ❱ Continue to directly invest in communities across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, protect the UK’s internal market and the integrity of our United Kingdom.
<02> MANIFESTO
<02> Our plan for a secure, dynamic and growing economy
<02> In 2010 we inherited an economy in tatters, with Labour admitting themselves there was ‘no money’. We have faced three generational global economic challenges: the aftermath of the financial crisis; a global pandemic; and the biggest energy shock since the 1970s.
<02> Against this backdrop, since 2010 the UK has had the third highest growth rate in the G7.
<02> We have created four million more jobs, cut taxes for working people and pensioners and repaired the public finances. The UK economy is now growing faster than Germany, France, Italy and the United States, real wages have been rising for nearly a year, inflation has fallen from 11.1% to 2.3%, lower than in Europe and the US, and debt as a share of GDP is forecast to start falling next year. The plan we set out last year, to halve inflation, grow the economy and reduce debt, is working.
<02> Economic security is the bedrock of any future success, which is why we have a clear plan to take the bold action needed to build a strong economy.
<02> ❱ reducing borrowing and debt;
<02> ❱ backing businesses to invest, innovate and
<02> trade;
<02> ❱ cutting taxes and reforming our welfare system;
<02> ❱ delivering world-class education; and
<02> ❱ delivering an affordable transition to
<02> domestic, sustainable energy.
<02> Reducing debt and borrowing
<02> Sustainable public finances are essential for a strong economic plan. It was only because of the difficult decisions we took to repair the public finances after 2010, which saw the deficit fall from 10.3% under Labour to 2.1% on the eve of the pandemic, that we were able to provide almost £400 billion of support to families and businesses to get through Covid and the energy shock.
<02> The only way to give people the peace of
<02> mind that government will be able to support them again when future shocks hit is to get borrowing and debt down. The alternative is to let borrowing get out of control, driving inflation and interest rates up, and leaving our children and grandchildren to pick up the bill.
<02> In the next Parliament, we will continue to meet our fiscal rules of having public sector net debt falling and for public sector net borrowing to be below 3% of GDP in the fifth year of the forecast. The measures in this manifesto
<02> are fully funded and would result in lower borrowing in 2029-30, which will be the target year for our fiscal rules in the first fiscal event of the new Parliament�
<02> Backing business to invest, innovate and trade
<02> A competitive tax system
<02> The Conservative Party will always be the party of business. It is the private sector which will unlock the investment, growth and opportunities of the future.
<02> That is why a tax system that incentivises business to invest is at the heart of our economic plan. We introduced the biggest business tax cut in modern British history, which hundreds of business leaders have described as the ‘single most transformational’ measure for growth and investment. So more businesses can benefit, we will look to extend our ‘full expensing’ policy to leasing, once
<02> the fiscal conditions allow. And we will not raise corporation tax. For the very smallest businesses, the four million people who are self-employed, we will abolish the main rate of National Insurance entirely by the end
<02> of the next Parliament. We will back the risk takers and entrepreneurs who help drive our economy.
<02> Small and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of our economy and we are making the UK the best place in the world to start or grow a business. We have great foundations: world-class talent, an internationally envied legal system and a business-friendly regulatory environment.
<02> We are supporting firms with a business rates support package worth £4.3 billion over the next five years to support small businesses and the high street. We want small businesses to get a bigger share of public contracts and have improved the public sector procurement system to that end. We have made it easier and cheaper for small businesses to hire an apprentice. And we have taken 28,000 small businesses out of paying VAT altogether
<02> by raising the VAT registration threshold to £90,000. In the next Parliament, we will deliver a ten point plan to support SMEs:
<02> 1� Continue to ease the burden of business rates for high street, leisure and hospitality businesses by increasing the multiplier on distribution warehouses that support online shopping over time.
<02> 2� Keep the VAT threshold under review and explore options to smooth the cliff edge at £90,000.
<02> 3� Improve access to finance for SMEs including through expanding Open Finance and by exploring the creation of Regional Mutual Banks.
<02> 4� Take more companies out of the scope of burdensome reporting requirements� Making use of freedoms granted by Brexit, we will lift the employee threshold allowing more companies to be considered medium-sized. This is expected to save small businesses at least one million hours of admin per year.
<02> 5� Retain key tax incentives that encourage small businesses to grow, including the Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme, Venture Capital Trusts, Business Asset Disposal Relief, Agricultural Property Relief and Business Relief. We will not increase Capital Gains Tax.
<02> 6� Promote digital invoicing and improve enforcement of the Prompt Payment Code
<02> to support small businesses with the perennial challenge of cashflow, building on our creation of the Small Business Commissioner with powers to tackle unfavourable payment practices.
<02> 7� Ensure that Basel III capital requirements do not inhibit lending to SMEs�
<02> 8� Continue our world leading programmes
<02> including the Invest in Women Task Force and the Lilac Review to encourage more female and disabled entrepreneurs.
<02> 9� Work with the British Business Bank and private sector fund managers to secure a £250 million Invest In Women Fund to support female entrepreneurs.
<02> 10� Work with public sector organisations
<02> including local authorities and NHS trusts
<02> and companies benefitting from government contracts to ensure that procurement opportunities are focused on SMEs in their local economies where possible and practical�
<02> Investing in infrastructure
<02> A Conservative Government will continue
<02> to invest in the digital, transport and energy infrastructure needed for businesses to grow.
<02> We have transformed our digital infrastructure by rolling out gigabit broadband to over a million hard to reach premises, helping to deliver high-speed internet to over 80% of the country. We are set to achieve at least 85% gigabit coverage of the UK by 2025 and nationwide coverage by 2030. Our ambition is for all populated areas to be covered by ‘standalone’ 5G mobile connectivity and to keep the UK at the forefront of adopting and developing 6G.
<02> We will spend £36 billion of HS2 savings on transport projects that will benefit more people, in more places, more quickly. Every penny saved in the North or Midlands will be spent there. Savings from our new plan for Euston,which will see 10,000 new homes built, have freed up £6.5 billion for transport across the rest of the country.
<02> Labour has no plan. They neither support
<02> the second phase of HS2 nor our alternative package of investment, meaning they won’t back schemes their own local leaders say will transform their areas. We will:
<02> ❱ Invest £4.7 billion for smaller cities, towns and rural areas in the North and Midlands to spend on their transport priorities. This will cut congestion and upgrade local bus and train stations.
<02> ❱ Invest a record £8.3 billion of investment to fill potholes and resurface roads. We will bring forward funding into this financial year and the next.
<02> ❱ Back our city regions with an additional £8.55 billion to spend on their local priorities. We will scrap rules that stop Mayors investing in strategic roads.
<02> ❱ Deliver our plan for Northern Powerhouse Rail bringing more frequent trains, more capacity and faster journeys. We have committed £12 billion on top of our HS2 savings to deliver the section of Northern Powerhouse Rail between Manchester and Liverpool. Savings from HS2 enable us to fund electrification to Hull and build a new station in Bradford.
<02> ❱ Boost rail connectivity in the Midlands, with £1.75 billion to fund the Midlands Rail Hub in full. This will improve journey times and deliver more frequent rail services at 50 stations, benefiting over seven million people. We will upgrade the line between Newark and Nottingham to halve journey times between Nottingham and Leeds.
<02> ❱ Provide an additional £1 billion to support hundreds of new bus routes across the North and Midlands.
<02> ❱ Improve accessibility at 100 train stations,starting with the 50 stations announced in May.
<02> ❱ Deliver upgrades to railways in the South West, including the line through Dawlish, the Energy Coast Line in Cumbria and the Ely Junction scheme in East Anglia.
<02> ❱ Electrify the North Wales Main Line with £1 billion of investment and alleviate pinch points on the A75 between Gretna and Stranraer.
<02> ❱ Reopen Beeching lines and stations to reconnect communities around the country, building on the success of the Dartmoor Line in the South West. We are committed to all the schemes set out in the Network North Command Paper.
<02> This comes on top of £44 billion of funding
<02> for Network Rail over the next five years and our investment in the Transpennine Route Upgrade, laying the foundations for Northern Powerhouse Rail. We will complete HS2 between London Euston and the West Midlands and support the growth of the rail freight sector.
<02> We have invested £40 billion in England’s strategic roads between 2015 and 2025, with further investment to come in the next Road Investment Strategy, ensuring we can deliver major roads including the Lower Thames Crossing and the A303. This is alongside the road schemes set out in our Network North plan, including the A1 between Morpeth and Ellingham.
<02> Automated vehicles will be on British roads in the next Parliament, thanks to our new world- leading legislation. We will support people to choose electric cars by ensuring our charging infrastructure is truly nationwide, including rapid charging and delivering the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate to support manufacturers to safeguard skilled British jobs.
<02> We will support the growth and decarbonisation of our aviation sector. We will back British Sustainable Aviation Fuel through our SAF mandate, an industry-backed revenue support mechanism and investment in future aviation technology. We will support domestic flights including through Public Service Obligations, protecting vital routes within the UK, including to islands and remote areas.
<02> We will back our maritime sector, including shipping and ports, as it decarbonises. Recognising the current challenges with cross-Solent transport, we will establish a review to explore all options to provide more choice and drive down fares. We will foster our science and innovation expertise in the space industry.
<02> Securing the UK’s position as a world leader in innovation
<02> Artificial intelligence (AI) will accelerate human progress in the 21st century, just as the steam engine and electricity did in the 19th century.
<02> The UK is well positioned to spearhead this transformation and is already leading global work on AI safety. Over the last 14 years, the Conservatives have turned the UK into a science and innovation superpower. The UK now has the highest level of direct government funding and tax support for business research and development (R&D) of any country in the OECD. We pioneered the fastest development and deployment of the Covid vaccine. The
<02> UK has Europe’s leading tech ecosystem. We have secured improved financial terms to join Horizon.
<02> In the next Parliament, we will:
<02> ❱ Increase public spending on R&D to £22 billion a year, up from £20 billion this year.
<02> ❱ Maintain our R&D tax reliefs. Recent changes worth £280 million a year have simplified and improved R&D tax reliefs, including by bringing more SMEs into scope of the relief.
<02> ❱ Continue investing over £1.5 billion in large-scale compute clusters, assembling the raw processing power so we can
<02> take advantage of the potential of AI
<02> and support research into its safe and responsible use.
<02> ❱ Push forward with our Advanced Manufacturing Plan, providing a £4.5 billion commitment to secure strategic manufacturing sectors including automotive, aerospace, life sciences and clean energy.
<02> ❱ Build on the success of our nine specialist Catapults, which support innovation and de-risk the transition from research and delivery, distributing £1.6 billion of funding across the country by 2028.
<02> We are proud to be the leading market for starting and growing a FinTech firm – part of our world-leading financial and professional services which supports the employment of almost 2.5 million people. We will build on
<02> the policies set out in the Edinburgh Reforms so that the UK continues to be the world’s most innovative and competitive global financial centre. We will support the City of London’s position as the leading global market through the implementation of the Mansion House reforms and measures such as a retail sale of NatWest shares. We will maintain the highest standards of consumer protection and prudential regulation to ensure there can never be a repeat of the banking crisis under the last Labour Government.
<02> The UK car industry is the jewel of our manufacturing crown. Last year the UK built over a million vehicles and secured £23.7 billion of private and public investment. We secured a £4 billion investment in a new battery gigafactory to be built in Somerset, safeguarding the future of the Jaguar Land Rover plant in the West Midlands for decades to come. Contrary to dire warnings that Brexit would lead to major brands leaving our shores. Nissan is delivering up to £2 billion of new investment to produce two new electric vehicle models in Sunderland and BMW made a £600 million investment to produce iconic all-electric Mini Coopers in Oxfordshire.
<02> We will always back our world-leading automotive industry, which faces unprecedented competition from China in the electric vehicles market. We stand ready to support domestic car manufacturers if there is evidence other countries are breaking global trade rules.
<02> Building new trade links to help British businesses thrive
<02> The UK is a global exporting superpower and is now the fourth biggest exporter in the world, having overtaken France, the Netherlands, and Japan.
<02> Having left the EU, we have seized the opportunity to negotiate trade deals that suit the UK, boosting our exports and creating jobs at home. UK exports are growing, reaching £850 billion last year and service exports are at an all-time high. We have secured trade deals with 73 countries plus the EU and last year
<02> we removed £1 million of trade barriers every single hour.
<02> Last year we signed a deal to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a modern and ambitious trade deal spanning economies across Asia and the Pacific. With the UK as a member, it will account for 15% of global GDP and in time is expected to boost UK GDP by around £2 billion a year.
<02> We will complete free trade agreements with India and with the Gulf Cooperation Council, home to some of the world’s biggest investors. And we will continue to pursue free trade agreements with countries such as Israel and Switzerland.
<02> Our Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) is the most comprehensive FTA the EU has ever agreed. We will build on it, but will not agree to anything in the forthcoming review
<02> of the TCA that would infringe our legal sovereignty or involve submission to the CJEU or dynamic alignment. We will take a tough approach on ensuring that the EU are meeting their commitments under the TCA and not discriminating against our exporters.
<02> We have always been clear the NHS and the services it provides are not on the table in trade negotiations. All food and drink products imported into the UK, including those from countries we have trade agreements with, must comply with the UK’s high standards. We will always stand up for UK agriculture in our trade deals.
<02> The US is our single largest trading partner. We have signed the Atlantic Declaration and deals with eight US states, including Florida and Texas, with a combined GDP of £5.7 trillion. And we will look to agree a free trade agreement with the US when they are ready to do so.
<02> Using our Brexit freedoms to deliver regulatory reform
<02> Conservatives believe in reducing the burden of regulation, freeing up businesses to thrive. We want small businesses free to innovate, balanced with proportionate protections
<02> for consumers and working people. We will never introduce Labour’s package of French- style union rules, which are a threat to jobs, our competitiveness and our economy. We will go further to transform the UK regulatory landscape, making sure regulators deliver the best outcomes for business, consumers and the environment.
<02> Thanks to Brexit, we have taken back control of our laws and freed British businesses from unnecessary burdens. We legislated to remove the principle of EU law supremacy and have undertaken a root-and-branch review of the more than 6,000 laws we had inherited from the EU.
<02> We have already repealed or reformed over 2,000 EU laws and by July 2026 we will
<02> have repealed or reformed over half of the entire stock of EU law we inherited. Only the Conservatives will keep on removing EU laws from our statute book. Our Smarter Regulation approach has already saved 50 million hours of administrative time for business, saving them an estimated £1 billion.
<02> We have also used post-Brexit tax freedoms, including introducing VAT-free installations
<02> of energy-efficient materials and replacing complex EU alcohol duty rates. And to protect our pubs we will maintain our Brexit Pubs Guarantee that means the duty on drinks on draught, such as beer and cider, will be less than in supermarkets.
<02> Cutting government bureaucracy
<02> We will make government more efficient, cut waste and attract the best and the brightest, by:
<02> ❱ Returning the civil service to its pre- pandemic size to pay for our commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP.
<02> ❱ Halving the amount of taxpayers’ money spent on external consultants. We will introduce controls on all ‘Equality, Diversity and Inclusion’ initiatives and spending.
<02> ❱ Bring quango spending under control.
<02> ❱ Moving 25,000 more civil servants outside of London, building on successes like the Darlington Economic Campus and hubs in Stoke-on-Trent and Wolverhampton.
<02> ❱ Opening up civil service recruitment by requiring jobs to be advertised externally to identify the best candidates.
<02> ❱ Doubling digital and AI expertise in the civil service, to take advantage of the latest technologies to transform public services.
<02> These reforms will allow us to achieve a significant productivity boost in Whitehall. If we returned public sector productivity to pre- pandemic levels that would deliver up to £20 billion of annual savings. The NHS Productivity Plan shows that the public sector can set out detailed plans for achieving a step-change in productivity, so we will require all Departments to deliver plans for 2% annual productivity growth at the next Spending Review.
<02> To limit the impact of industrial action on public services and balance the ability of workers
<02> to strike with the rights of the public, we will continue implementing our Minimum Service Levels legislation.
<02> Speeding up infrastructure delivery
<02> We can only achieve our infrastructure ambitions if we continue to simplify the planning system to make it easier to build, faster. We will speed up the average time it takes to sign off major infrastructure projects from four years to one. We will:
<02> ❱ Introduce reforms to outdated EU red tape to better protect nature while enabling the building of new homes, new prisons and new energy schemes. Along with the reforms to the EU’s bureaucratic environmental impact assessment regime that we have already started, these changes will speed up local and national infrastructure planning systems.
<02> ❱ Ensure any requirements to offset the impact of new infrastructure and homes on an area are proportionate, without compromising environmental outcomes.
<02> ❱ Reduce the cost of infrastructure by allowing quicker changes to consented projects.
<02> ❱ Ensure National Policy Statements are regularly updated.
<02> ❱ Focus the role of statutory consultees in the planning system on improving projects in line with clearer objectives, rather than piecemeal requirements that add delays.
<02> ❱ End frivolous legal challenges that frustrate infrastructure delivery by amending the law so judicial reviews that don’t have merit do not waste court time.
<02> manifesto
<02> Our plan to cut taxes and protect pensions
<02> As Conservatives, we believe in lower taxes because people, not governments, make the best decisions about how to spend their money. But we can only ever cut taxes responsibly when we have a way to fund it sustainably, consistent with getting debt and borrowing down and in a way which does not send inflation spiralling.
<02> Because of the support we provided to families and businesses through Covid and the energy shock, we had to make difficult decisions to pay down our debts. But we were clear that once inflation was under control and the public finances were on a sustainable path, we would cut taxes. Because of the progress we have made, with inflation back to normal and debt on track to fall from next year, we have been able to afford to begin cutting taxes as part of our plan to reward work and grow the economy,
<02> all without increasing borrowing or cutting spending on public services.
<02> Cutting tax for working people
<02> In the first half of this year, we began cutting National Insurance. It is unfair that working people pay two taxes on their income – income tax and National Insurance – when other people only pay income tax.
<02> Our long-term ambition, when it is affordable to do so, is to keep cutting National Insurance until it’s gone, as part of our plan to make the tax system simpler and fairer. As the next step in that plan, we will cut employee National Insurance to 6% by April 2027 – meaning that we will have halved it from 12% at the beginning of this year, a total tax cut of £1,350 for the average worker on £35,000. This comes on top of the significant above inflation increase to the personal allowance we have delivered since 2010, nearly doubling it from £6,475 to £12,750.
<02> This means the tax burden on workers is falling, with the average earner paying the lowest effective personal tax rate since 1975 – lower than in the US, France, Germany or any G7 country.
<02> As a further downpayment on our long-term ambition to abolish National Insurance, there is one group for whom we will make that
<02> a reality in the next Parliament. Last year,
<02> the main rate of National Insurance for the self-employed stood at 9%. To recognise the unique contribution of these risk-takers and entrepreneurs to our economy and the insecurity they face without the rights and protections that employees enjoy,
<02> we will abolish it entirely by the end of
<02> the next Parliament. The abolition of the
<02> main rate of Class 4 National Insurance contributions builds on our abolition of Class 2 contributions for self-employed people from April this year. This will not affect their entitlement to the State Pension. This is a massive simplification of the tax system which means that 93% of self-employed people – four million of them – will no longer pay self- employed National Insurance.
<02> As well as cutting National Insurance for 29 million people, we will also not raise the rate of income tax or VAT.
<02> Increasing pay for working people
<02> We introduced the National Living Wage in 2016 and this year achieved our ambition of raising it to two thirds of median earnings – increasing it to £11.44 per hour and extending it to cover all workers aged over 21. This ended low pay for those on the National Living Wage, with someone working full-time receiving a pay rise worth £1,800. As a result of our personal tax cuts and increases in the minimum wage, the take-home pay of someone working full time on the National Living Wage has gone up by 35% in real terms since 2010.
<02> We will maintain the National Living Wage
<02> in each year of the next Parliament at two-thirds of median earnings. On current forecasts, that would mean it rising to around £13 per hour, up from a minimum wage of £5.80 under Labour in 2010.
<02> We will ensure the UK retains the flexible and dynamic labour market that gives businesses the confidence to create jobs and invest in their workforce. The number of payrolled employees is at a near record high, and there are around four million more people in work than when we came to office in 2010. Cutting tax for pensioners
<02> We believe that those who have worked hard during their lives should have dignity and security in their retirement. We came to power in 2010 after Labour had hit pensioners with a £118 billion pensions tax raid and a paltry 75p per week increase to the State Pension.
<02> Since 2010, we have made it a priority to give people peace of mind in their retirement. We introduced the Triple Lock, which has seen the basic State Pension rise by £3,700 since 2010. This year, the new State Pension increased by £900.
<02> We will continue to do everything we can to provide pensioners with dignity in retirement and ensure the new State Pension is not dragged into income tax for the first time in history by introducing the new Triple Lock Plus. This has two elements:
<02> 1. Continuing to uprate the State Pension in line with the highest of prices, earnings or 2.5%. On current forecasts, this will mean the new State Pension increases by a further £430 in April next year to £11,970; and increases by £1,685 a year to £13,200 by the end of the Parliament. 2. Ensuring that from next year the tax- free personal allowance for pensioners also rises by the highest of prices, earnings or 2.5%, guaranteeing that the new State Pension is always below the tax-free threshold. From April 2025, we will increase the personal allowance for pensioners by introducing a new age-related personal allowance. This is a tax cut of around £100 for eight million pensioners next year – rising to £275 a year by the end of the Parliament.
<02> Under our new Pensions Tax Guarantee, the Conservatives will not introduce any new taxes on pensions. We will maintain the 25% tax free lump sum and maintain tax relief on pension contributions at their marginal rate. We will not extend National Insurance to employer pension contributions.
<02> We will maintain all current pensioner benefits, including free bus passes, Winter Fuel Payments, free prescriptions and TV licences. We are carefully considering the Ombudsman report into WASPI women and will work with Parliament to provide an appropriate and swift response.
<02> By opposing the Triple Lock Plus, Labour’s Retirement Tax will mean millions of pensioners paying more tax. It will also mean that for
<02> the first time in history, someone whose
<02> only income is the new State Pension will
<02> be dragged into paying income tax, which alongside making them worse off means the administrative burden of going through a tax assessment.
<02> Clamping down on tax avoidance
<02> It is vital we make sure people and companies are paying the tax they owe. That’s why,
<02> since 2010, Conservative Governments have introduced over 200 measures to tackle tax non-compliance. In total across all the fiscal events we have delivered since 2010, the OBR has scored these measures as raising £95 billion across the forecasts it has produced – £6.7 billion for each year. Building on that, we will raise at least a further £6 billion a year from tackling tax avoidance and evasion by the end of the Parliament.
<02> manifesto
<02> Our plan to get more people into work and build
<02> a fairer welfare system
<02> We believe in fairness and the value of hard work. Alongside a tax system that rewards work, we want a welfare system which supports everyone to fulfil their potential and live dignified and independent lives. There should always be a safety net for those who need it most; but those who can work to support themselves, should work, and they should be better off for doing so.
<02> Since 2010, we have delivered transformational reforms to put work at the heart of our welfare system. We have rolled out Universal Credit and cut its taper rate by 10p in the pound to make work pay. We’ve brought discipline to
<02> the system through tougher sanctions and conditionality. We introduced the household benefit cap and the two-child limit to make the system fairer to the taxpayers who pay for it and ensure benefits are always a safety net, not a lifestyle choice.
<02> All of this has delivered near record levels
<02> of employment and low unemployment, with around four million more people in work since we came to office.
<02> At the same time, we have protected the most vulnerable, safeguarding millions of jobs through the pandemic and delivering unprecedented support to help households through the energy shock from Putin’s war.
<02> Since the pandemic, new challenges have emerged. The number of people who are economically inactive due to ill health has risen from 2 million to 2.8 million, with a significant increase in mental health conditions among younger people. As a result, the number of working age people claiming benefits is projected to grow at an unsustainable rate, with all the wasted human potential that entails.
<02> We are now spending £69 billion a year on benefits for people of working age with a disability or health condition, a figure which
<02> has risen by two thirds since the pandemic.
<02> By the end of the decade, that spending is projected to increase to £90 billion. It would be irresponsible not to take bold action to put the welfare system on a sustainable footing.
<02> So we will reform the system to make it fairer and more sustainable, unlocking the potential of millions of people and giving them the support they need to get into work.
<02> This next generation of welfare reforms will build a system fit for the post-pandemic world. They will give everyone who can the best possible chance of returning to work, while providing the right support to those who need it. With fewer people moving onto welfare and more people in work fulfilling their potential, we will save taxpayers £12 billion a year. To deliver this, we will take a two-pronged approach.
<02> First, to address the unsustainable rise in benefit claims for people of working age with a disability or health condition, we will:
<02> ❱ Reform our disability benefits so they
<02> are better targeted and reflect people’s genuine needs, while delivering a step- change in mental health provision. We
<02> will improve PIP assessments to provide a more objective consideration of people’s needs and stop the number of claims from rising unsustainably. While people suffering with mental health conditions face significant challenges, it is not clear that they always face the same additional living costs as people with physical disabilities. We will look at the best way to provide support, including whether treatment or services could be more appropriate for some people than a monthly cash payment, while also delivering a dramatic expansion in mental health support. At the same time, we will make the assessment process simpler and fairer for those with the most severe conditions. Tighten up how the benefits system assesses capability for work. People
<02> are now three times more likely to be assessed as not fit for any work and put on the highest tier of sickness benefits than they were a decade ago. We will change the assessments from September 2025
<02> so that those with more moderate mental health issues or mobility problems who could potentially engage with the world of work are given tailored support, instead
<02> of being written off on benefits. The OBR has forecast that these reforms will reduce the number of people on these benefits by 424,000.
<02> ❱ Overhaul the fit note process so that people are not being signed off sick as
<02> a default. Currently, 94% of fit notes are being signed off as ‘not fit for work’. We will design a new system which moves the responsibility for issuing fit notes away from our hard-pressed GPs towards specialist work and health professionals, and we will test integrating this with the new WorkWell service to provide tailored support to help people stay in or get back to work.
<02> Second, to make sure that being on benefits remains a safety net, not a lifestyle choice, we will:
<02> ❱ Introduce tougher sanctions rules so people who refuse to take up suitable jobs after 12 months on benefits can have their cases closed and their benefits removed entirely. We will bring forward the new claimant review point for the long-term unemployed from 18 months to 12 months. At the claimant review, Work Coaches will set renewed conditions for claimants. If they fail to accept or comply with those conditions, such as refusing a suitable job or a mandatory work placement, their claim will be closed and their benefits will stop.
<02> Accelerate the rollout of Universal Credit to ensure it always pays to work. We will move all of those remaining on outdated legacy benefits onto Universal Credit, removing disincentives for them to work and ensuring they will always be better off in work.
<02> ❱ Continue to clamp down on fraudsters. Since 2019 we have delivered cumulative scored savings of £7.7 billion through measures we have taken to tackle fraud in the welfare system. Despite this, the level of welfare fraud remains far too high, having more than doubled during the pandemic. To deliver further savings, we will maintain our zero-tolerance approach to fraud. This will include a new Fraud
<02> Bill to give DWP powers similar to that
<02> of HMRC, so we can treat benefit fraud like we do tax fraud with new powers to identify, investigate and pursue fraudsters.
<02> We hugely value the work that unpaid carers do supporting their loved ones. We have increased Carer’s Allowance by almost £1,500 since 2010 and given employees who are also unpaid carers entitlement to a period of unpaid leave. We will continue to stand behind our carers.
<02> The vast majority of parents work incredibly hard to give their children the best start in life, but sadly a small number shirk their responsibilities. We will reform the Child Maintenance Service to prevent non- compliance and new laws to help crack down on non-payment. We’ll also look at how the Service can better support victims of domestic or economic abuse, building on recommendations from Dr Samantha Callan’s 2023 Independent Review.
<02> Our plan to give young people the opportunities and skills they need
<02> Education is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet, which is why since 2010 we have focused on driving up standards in education. English children are now the best readers in the Western world and are 11th in the world for maths, up from 27th when Labour left office in 2010. Children in England now far outperform their peers in Labour- run Wales and SNP-run Scotland. We will build on this success to make sure every child gets a world- class education and reaches their full potential.
<02> Giving every child the chance to go to a great school
<02> Today, 90% of schools are Good or Outstanding, up from 68% in 2010. School funding is at its highest ever level in real terms per pupil and there are record numbers of teachers, 27,000 more than 2010. The pupil premium, introduced by the Conservatives in 2011, will allocate almost £3 billion next year to support disadvantaged children to reach their full potential. Free school meals have been extended to more groups of children than under any other government over the past half a century. We will build on this progress in the next Parliament by protecting day-to-day schools spending in real terms per pupil.
<02> None of this progress has been possible without our great teachers. We have hit our 2019 manifesto commitment to introduce starting salaries of £30,000 and are backing headteachers to manage behaviour and enforce discipline. We will require schools to follow our guidance on banning the use of mobile phones during the school day, which is proven to boost attainment, reduce bullying and support good behaviour in schools. We will attract more talented teachers by expanding our recruitment and retention premium and reducing workload. From this September, new teachers in priority areas and key STEM and technical subjects will receive bonuses of up to £30,000 tax-free over five years. We will extend the payments to eligible teachers in
<02> our further education colleges. We will always support and celebrate our further education colleges.
<02> We will champion excellence in our classrooms. In primary schools, we will support teachers
<02> to use tried and tested techniques, including our world-leading phonics programme and our mastery approach to maths, enabling every child to master the basics before they start secondary school. We will support children in their transition to secondary school and ensure they continue to receive a broad and enriched education during and after-school, including via our multi-million pound Music Hubs.
<02> We will mandate two hours of PE every week in primary and secondary schools, supported by extending the PE and Sport Premium to secondary schools. We will increase funding for School Games Organisers to get more competitive sport into and between schools and work with sporting bodies to create more UK-wide school competitions like National Finals, to identify the best sporting talents.
<02> To keep pace with our global competitors we will introduce the Advanced British Standard, a new approach to 16-19 education which will build on the best of A Levels and T Levels. We will end the artificial and damaging divide between academic and technical education which has persisted for far too long. Every young person will spend more time in the classroom, learning more subjects, including English and maths to 18, as they do in most advanced economies around the world.
<02> For children and young people to benefit from the bold reforms we have made to education, they must be in school. The legacy of Covid has made this more difficult. We will continue to work with schools and local authorities to improve school attendance, including through more mental health support, building on our plan that is working – there were 440,000 fewer children persistently absent last year compared to the year before. And to ensure all children are getting a high-quality education, including those who are home schooled, we will legislate to create a register of children not in school.
<02> We will work to strengthen the relationship between schools and parents, including by delivering new legislation which will make clear, beyond all doubt, that parents have a right to see what their child is being taught in school and schools must share all materials, especially on sensitive matters like relationships and sex education. This builds on the progress we have already made, having updated Relationships, Sex and Health Education Guidance to introduce clear age-limits on what children can be taught and guarantee the contested concept of gender identity is not taught to children.
<02> We will expand strong academy trusts. This builds on our record to date, where half of all state-funded schools are now academies and over 700 free schools have been delivered, with more in the pipeline. We will further protect parents’ choice on where to send their child to school, including preserving the rights of independent and grammar schools. We will lift the cap on faith schools, allowing them to offer more places to children based on faith and encouraging them to expand. We will back Ofsted to provide clear judgements to parents on the quality and safety of schools. We are rebuilding over 500 schools through the School Rebuilding Programme, including rebuilding
<02> or refurbishing every school identified to have RAAC.
<02> We will transform education for children
<02> with special educational needs, ending the postcode lottery of support by delivering 60,000 more school places and a further 15 new free schools for children with special educational needs. Instead of penalising independent special schools by taxing them, we will back them because we believe in the right of parents to choose the best education for their child.
<02> Facilitating training and skills at every stage of life
<02> We believe in giving young people the
<02> best possible start to their adult lives and going to university is not the only route to success. The Conservatives have prioritised apprenticeships after they were neglected under Labour. Since 2010, we have delivered 5.8 million apprenticeships and have created apprenticeship routes into 70% of occupations, including through degree apprenticeships.
<02> We passed new laws requiring children to be taught about technical education opportunities, not just university routes, and have set up 21 Institutes of Technology. We will build on this by creating 100,000 more apprenticeships in England every year by the end of next Parliament.
<02> We will fund this by changing the law to close university courses in England with the worst outcomes for their students. Courses that have excessive drop-out rates or leave students worse off than had they not gone to university will be prevented from recruiting students
<02> by the universities regulator. This will protect students from being missold and the taxpayer from having to pay where the graduate can’t.
<02> We are committed to delivering the best value for students, so have already reformed student loans to make them fairer, meaning no one will pay back more than what they borrowed in real terms. And we will work with universities to ensure students get the contact hours they are promised and their exams get marked.
<02> We will support the National Citizen Service to help young people build confidence and develop the skills they need to thrive.
<02> We will deliver the Lifelong Learning Entitlement, giving adults the support they need to train, retrain and upskill flexibly throughout their working lives. From the 2025 academic year, adults will be able to apply
<02> for loans to cover new qualifications. We
<02> will also continue to expand our adult skills programmes, such as Skills Bootcamps which meet skills shortages.
<02> A new model of modern National Service
<02> We will reinvent National Service for this century to give young people valuable life skills and build a stronger national culture. National Service will be compulsory, so it becomes a rite of passage for every 18-year-old, but young people will be given a choice, between:
<02> ❱ civic service. The equivalent of one weekend a month (25 days a year) volunteering in the community, alongside work or study, for a year. Roles could include special constable, NHS responder or RNLI volunteer; or
<02> ❱ military service. A year-long full-time placement in the armed forces or cyber defence. This placement will be competitive and paid, so our armed forces recruit and train the brightest and the best.
<02> We will establish a Royal Commission, the first in a quarter of a century, to design our modernised National Service. It will be backed by funding rising to £2.5 billion in the final year of the Parliament and a new National Service Act.
<02> Our plan to secure our nation from global uncertainty
<02> The world is an increasingly dangerous place so we will take bold action to keep the British people safe and our homeland secure. Our prosperity depends on our ability to preserve international security. As our record proves,
<02> we will do so by deterring our adversaries and acting as a force for peace and stability in the world.
<02> We will fully deliver our new pledge for the defence of the nation.
<02> We will hit 2.5% of GDP on defence in 2030 with our fully funded plan. This is the biggest strengthening of our defence since the Cold War, ensuring we remain the largest defence power in Europe. It will protect our security, cement our UK leadership in NATO and create more jobs in the UK.
<02> If all NATO partners spent 2.5% of GDP on defence, our collective spending would increase by over £140 billion. Therefore, we will launch a campaign to set a new baseline of 2.5% for all NATO allies by 2030.
<02> We will invest in the vital capabilities of the future, to give our Armed Forces the best equipment to do their job.
<02> Taking pride in our record
<02> ❱ We have led the world in support of Ukraine against Putin’s aggression, as the first European country to mobilise lethal
<02> aid and to send Western tanks and long- range missiles. Russia’s attempts to destroy Ukraine are an assault on European security.
<02> ❱ We will always be steadfast in our support for our Trident nuclear deterrent and have invested in its modernisation, including a nuclear skills package worth up to £763 million by 2030.
<02> ❱ We have taken action to prevent Iran and its proxies from attacking the UK and its partners.
<02> ❱ We have toughened our cyber defences and national security laws to protect the nation from terrorists and hostile state actors.
<02> ❱ We have chased dirty money out of the UK with new measures to protect our economic security.
<02> ❱ We have ripped out Huawei from key
<02> parts of our telecommunications system and reduced Chinese influence in our critical national infrastructure and sensitive technological sectors.
<02> ❱ Due to our post-Brexit freedoms, we have introduced a new independent sanctions regime that we have used to stand up for human rights around the world in countries such as Russia, Belarus and Iran.
<02> ❱ We have agreed new trade and security deals across the world including in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Indo-Pacific.
<02> ❱ We have delivered major new investment. The Integrated Review was supported by an additional £24 billion and the Integrated Review Refresh by an additional £5 billion to invest in stockpiles and our nuclear enterprise. We have pledged over £12 billion to date on support to Ukraine.
<02> ❱ We have created new defence industrial partnerships, including AUKUS to create the world’s most advanced nuclear- powered, conventionally and continually armed, submarines and the Global Combat Air Programme to create a new fighter jet with Italy and Japan.
<02> ❱ We will always stand up for British values and interests and will never be afraid to act when it is necessary. We have been part of a coalition that protected maritime security from Houthi attacks and helped police the airspace of our partners in the Middle East.
<02> Our strategic defence priorities
<02> We will adapt to the lessons from the war
<02> in Ukraine which showed us it is vital to be able to replenish equipment quickly and that the acceleration of disruptive technologies is changing the character of warfare. Our strategic priorities will be:
<02> ❱ Boosting the UK defence industrial base by giving industry the multi-year certainty it requires to produce the equipment
<02> we need when we need it, with at least
<02> £10 billion of investment in munitions production, the majority of which will be spent in the UK over the next decade. We will do this in the areas in which we have the most pressing priorities, building on UK expertise. We will build long-term strategic partnerships with our industrial partners and invest in high quality British defence industry jobs across the UK.
<02> ❱ Accelerating the modernisation of our Armed Forces and investing in technology that is advantageous on the modern battlefield. Through our new Defence Innovation Agency, we will scale R&D funding to a minimum of 5% of the defence budget, together with an additional 2% to exploit that R&D, accelerating investments in new weapon systems.
<02> ❱ Guaranteeing Ukraine the support it needs for the long haul, assuring current levels of support for as long as they are required. We will secure additional military supplies for Ukraine and build international agreement to use immobilised Russian assets to support Ukraine.
<02> We will deliver a National Defence and Resilience Plan for our security, preparedness and resilience as a nation. This will be based on the latest assessment of threats and risks, bringing together defence and civilian planning to reflect our increasingly interdependent world, and sit alongside work to build on learnings from Covid to improve the country’s preparedness for risks on the National Risk Register.
<02> We will improve Service Family Accommodation, improving quality and ensuring military families get the support they deserve.
<02> Our pledge to Veterans
<02> We are proud to have created the United Kingdom’s first Office for Veterans Affairs, run by a dedicated Minister who attends Cabinet, transforming what it feels like to be a Veteran in the United Kingdom.
<02> ❱ We will maintain the Office for Veterans Affairs in its current position in the Cabinet Office, with a dedicated Minister for Veterans Affairs in Cabinet.
<02> ❱ We will maintain the base operating budget of the Office for Veterans Affairs at £10 million throughout the next Parliament. We will retain the National Insurance holiday for those who employ veterans and we will bring forward measures so that War Pensions and Armed Forces Compensation Scheme awards are not counted as income for the purpose of benefits and pensions.
<02> ❱ We will extend the visa fees waiver introduced to cover Commonwealth personnel, to include their direct dependants. We will fully implement the findings of the independent review into Veterans UK. We will bring forward measures to ensure public bodies record whether someone has served in the UK’s Armed Forces.
<02> ❱ We will cut the cost of the Veterans Railcard so that it costs the same as the HM Forces Railcard.
<02> ❱ We will pass the UK’s first ever Veterans’ Bill to enshrine Veterans’ rights in law. Ensuring qualifications from Service are correctly recognised in civilian life, creating a legal duty on government to look after our Veterans and widening the scope of the Armed Forces Covenant in law to include the UK Government and devolved administrations.
<02> ❱ We will change the law to ensure Veterans ID cards are valid identification in all future elections.
<02> Improving efficiency and investing across the United Kingdom
<02> Defence already contributes significantly to our economic prosperity, supporting over 400,000 jobs in the UK. As part of our new investment in defence, we will prioritise growth in UK industries and supporting communities across the United Kingdom.
<02> We will make sure new investment is spent more effectively than before. By delivering our new Integrated Procurement Model, we will make defence procurement faster, smarter and more joined up, boost private sector investment by confirming that ESG considerations are entirely consistent with investment in our vital defence industry and transform innovation.
<02> We will ensure we achieve value for money from this investment in defence alongside our procurement reforms. We will improve productivity, along with a new target to become the largest defence exporter in Europe by 2030.
<02> Leadership in the world
<02> Since the 2019 election, the Conservative Government has delivered on our promise to make Britain a force for good in the world.
<02> We are proud of our record in defence and diplomacy in an increasingly contested and dangerous world and we celebrate the professionalism of our Armed Forces, diplomats, development experts and intelligence agencies.
<02> Our highest priority remains protecting the British homeland, Crown dependencies and Overseas Territories from risks and threats. As part of that, we continue to ensure the democratic rights of people in Gibraltar, the Falklands and all our Overseas Territories are protected.
<02> We believe that the United Kingdom needs to be outward-looking and global in perspective, seizing opportunities to deepen its economic ties and bolster its prosperity in the most dynamic parts of the world.
<02> We have a record in standing up to those who threaten our security and values, and we are taking new action to protect ourselves, our democracy and our economy at home.
<02> We must be prepared to tackle the axis of authoritarian states and hostile actors who are working together to threaten international security. That is why we will include Russia, Iran and China within the enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme.
<02> ❱
<02> We will strengthen our relationships with like-minded partners around the world. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the UK has a responsibility to stand up for international peace and security. We will keep investing in our collective security through groups like the G7, Five Eyes and NATO.
<02> We will maintain our special relationship with the United States, building on the closer trading and national security ties we have built in recent years.
<02> ❱
<02> We will seek to strengthen the Commonwealth, as an organisation
<02> that accounts for over a quarter of the membership of the UN and a champion of values. We will deepen cooperation with Commonwealth partners and institutions
<02> to enhance the benefits of membership, strengthen intra-Commonwealth trade, support members facing challenges
<02> in attracting inward investment and strengthen the resilience of the most vulnerable members to climate change, nature loss and environmental degradation.
<02> ❱
<02> We will build on our post-Brexit relationships in Europe, including through the Joint Expeditionary Force and new
<02> defensive treaties with Germany and Poland, to match the treaty we have with France under Lancaster House.
<02> ❱ In relation to China, we will strengthen our national security protections, align and cooperate with our partners, and engage where it is consistent with our interests. China has disregarded universal human rights and its international commitments, from Tibet and Xinjiang to Hong Kong. We will continue to raise our grave concerns at the UN and other fora and use asset freezes and travel bans on those involved under our human rights sanctions regime.
<02> ❱ We will maintain our close ties in the Indo- Pacific, following our accession to CPTPP, our AUKUS partnership with Australia and ASEAN dialogue partner status. We will bolster the Hiroshima Accord with Japan and expand trade and security ties with South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam and Singapore. We will finalise a free trade agreement with India, alongside a deeper strategic partnership on technology and defence.
<02> ❱ We will continue to seek closer ties with partners in the Gulf and Middle East based on an appreciation of regional perspectives and shared interests.
<02> ❱ We will sign partnership agreements with each of the British Overseas Territories, ensuring we are working together to deliver for their residents and identifying areas for greater cooperation on defence, trade and investment.
<02> To ensure our world-class diplomacy and development expertise is brought together we will maintain the merger of the Foreign Office and former Department for International Development – and use this advantage to the maximum benefit in every post overseas.
<02> The UK will remain one of the largest development donors in the world. We will return to spending 0.7% of GNI when fiscal circumstances allow. We will assess every penny of this money with a strict national interest test.
<02> ❱ We will continue to ensure that aid and development supports our strategic objectives, with a focus on fragile states. We will work with our partners to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals
<02> and tackle poverty, as set out in the International Development White Paper.
<02> ❱ We will use our influence to ensure Multilateral Development Banks get more money to the countries who need it and work to deliver debt relief.
<02> ❱ We will expand our international campaigns on girls’ education, women’s rights and reproductive health. We will stand up for those persecuted for their faith and put the existing role of Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief on a statutory footing. We will promote international media freedom and work to end human trafficking and modern slavery.
<02> ❱ We will support marginalised communities in the developing world and protect those persecuted for their ethnicity, political views, faith or sexuality. We will continue our campaigns against child marriage and FGM.
<02> ❱ We will scale up high impact, cost effective global health interventions, including maternal nutrition and antimicrobial resistance, for benefit at home and overseas. We will continue our longstanding support for GAVI and the Global Fund - organisations that have saved millions of lives in the fight against disease.
<02> We will maintain the leadership on climate change we achieved at COP26 and our efforts to tackle global warming and biodiversity loss.
<02> We will continue to ring-fence our commitment to International Climate Finance.
<02> We will work with Small Island Development States, including our Commonwealth friends in the Caribbean and the Pacific, to access finance for climate change adaptation and resilience.
<02> We will be confident in spreading British values around the world, publishing a new Soft Power Strategy to support the role of our embassies and the British Council overseas. We will support the BBC World Service, expand the use of the English language worldwide and champion English learning around the globe.
<02> We will not apologise for standing up for our values and we will work against the global rollback on people’s rights and freedoms. We will use all the tools available to us, including travel bans and sanctions, on individuals and entities that warrant it.
<02> We have delivered on our manifesto pledge to introduce ‘votes for life’ for British citizens living overseas. We will appoint a Minister for British Citizens Overseas to represent them across government.
<02> The UK has a strong record of providing world-leading consular support to our citizens overseas and we will ensure British nationals abroad get help when they need it. We will introduce a new model for complex detention cases, with new Family Advocates to help provide specialist assistance and give greater confidence to families.
<02> We are proud to be a problem-solving
<02> and burden-sharing nation. We will use
<02> our diplomatic efforts to keep pushing for reconciliation and stability in parts of the world where there is conflict or unresolved territorial disputes.
<02> We staunchly stand behind Israel’s right to defend itself and to live with security. We will continue to support access to aid for those affected by the conflict. We will push for a two-state solution in the Middle East - our long-standing position has been that we will recognise a Palestinian State at a time that is most conducive to the peace process. We will redouble our efforts to help achieve diplomatic breakthroughs in Cyprus, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Myanmar.
<02> We will bring back our Bill to ban public bodies from imposing their own boycott or divestment campaigns against foreign countries and territories.
<02> We will intensify our fight to stop money laundering and dirty money and ensure all British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies adopt open registers of beneficial ownership.
<02> Our plan to control immigration and stop illegal immigrationIllegal migration is unfair.
<02> It is unfair for people to jump the queue in front of people who play by the rules. It is unfair for taxpayers to pay for the hotels and public services. And it is unfair for illegal migrants themselves who risk their lives in the hands of people smugglers.
<02> The Conservatives are the only party with a plan to stop the boats and reduce the strain that illegal migration places on our communities and public services. Labour have no plan and would grant an amnesty to thousands of illegal migrants.
<02> We have made progress. Last year, small boat arrivals to the UK fell by a third. Our work with international partners prevented more than 26,000 crossings last year. Our Albania deal shows that deterrence works, with numbers down 90%.
<02> But the only way to stop the boats entirely is
<02> to remove the incentive to come – by making clear that if you come here illegally, you will not be allowed to stay. Only then will the boats stop coming and people stop dying in the Channel. We will:
<02> ❱ Establish a deterrent. We will run
<02> a relentless, continual process of permanently removing illegal migrants to Rwanda with a regular rhythm of flights every month, starting this July, until the boats are stopped. If we are forced to choose between our security and the jurisdiction of a foreign court, including the ECtHR, we will always choose our security.
<02> ❱ End the legal merry-go-round. We will stop illegal migrants from bringing spurious challenges to block their removal by bringing our Illegal Migration Act into force and clearing the asylum backlog, with all claims processed in six months and the use of hotels ended.
<02> ❱ Crack down on organised immigration crime, including through the National Crime Agency and our intelligence services, to disrupt supply chains and tackle people smugglers.
<02> ❱ Reform asylum rules, holding an international summit and working with other countries to reform international laws to make them fit for an age of mass migration. We will restrict visa access from countries that don’t work with us on our national priorities, like illegal migration.
<02> ❱ Return people with no right to be here
<02> to their own country. We will sign further returns deals like the one we have already agreed with Albania.
<02> ❱ With control of our borders, we can do more to help refugees fleeing persecution. In addition to maintaining visa schemes for people fleeing Hong Kong, Ukraine and our Afghan settlement schemes, we will give parliament control of how many places we offer on safe and legal routes to support those in genuine need from around the world, with a cap based on the capacity of local areas.
<02> Delivering sustainable levels of high-skilled migration
<02> Immigration is too high. We want to attract the brightest and best skilled migrants to the UK to contribute to our businesses and public services. We must bring migration numbers down to sustainable levels to reduce the impacts on public services and housing and to restore public confidence in the system.
<02> We have already implemented changes which mean that 300,000 people who were eligible to come the UK last year now couldn’t. We have:
<02> ❱ Ended the ability of almost all international students and all care workers to bring dependants.
<02> ❱ Scrapped cut-price shortage labour from overseas, by abolishing the 20% going rate salary discount for shortage occupations.
<02> ❱ Stopped immigration from undercutting British workers, by increasing the salary threshold for Skilled Worker visas by 48% to £38,700.
<02> ❱ Ensured those sponsoring dependants can support them financially, by raising the minimum income for family visas to £38,700.
<02> Going forward, we will raise the Skilled Worker threshold and Family income requirement with inflation automatically to make sure they don’t undercut UK workers.
<02> We have taken steps to ensure those coming to the UK do not place a burden on the NHS, by requiring them to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge and increasing this to £1,035. We
<02> will go further, in line with other countries,
<02> by requiring migrants to undergo a health check in advance of travel and increasing their Immigration Health Surcharge or requiring them to buy health insurance if they are likely to be a burden on the NHS.
<02> We will increase all visa fees and remove the student discount to the Immigration Health Surcharge to raise more money for public services.
<02> We will continue to attract the brightest and best students to study in our world class institutions. We will ensure those who come here are able to integrate into communities and participate in the economy. We want
<02> to make sure our immigration system is fair and will continue delivering the Windrush Compensation Scheme. We are committed to the EU Settled Status Scheme and the rights it has guaranteed for EU citizens.
<02> Our plan to cut migration
<02> We need to control numbers and give the public confidence they will come down significantly.
<02> ❱ We will introduce a binding, legal cap on migration, set on work and family visas so public services are protected whilst we bring the skills our businesses and the NHS needs.
<02> ❱ Our cap will be set at a level that explicitly takes into account the costs and the benefits of migration.
<02> ❱ The cap will fall every year of the next Parliament and cannot be breached.
<02> ❱ We will give parliament an annual vote on the level of the cap so that the British people can have confidence that immigration numbers will be controlled.
<02> ❱ Unlike Labour, we won’t allow any form of free movement to return.
<02> national insurance
<02> We will cut taxes for working people
<02> The Conservatives are the party of workers, the people who fuel our economy and keep our country going.
<02> So we want workers to know we have their backs. And that’s why we’re taking bold action to tackle National Insurance, an unfair double tax on work.
<02> Right now, workers have to pay two taxes: income tax as well as National Insurance. It’s not fair on workers and it’s not good for our economy.
<02> That’s why the Conservatives have a clear plan.
<02> So far, we’ve cut National Insurance by a third — from 12% to 8%. That’s a £900 tax cut for someone on an average salary of £34,500.
<02> It’s a good start. But the Prime Minister wants to go further.
<02> If you vote to stick with the plan, Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have set out our long-term ambition to abolish National Insurance entirely.
<02> So we’ll end the unfair double tax on work and support the workers who keep our economy going.
<02> You can make this happen. Vote Conservative on Thursday 4 July.
<02> Rishi Sunak and the
<02> Conservatives are the only party with the clear plan Britain needs.
<02> You and your family deserve a secure future.
<02> Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will deliver it. We've got a clear plan and we've proven that we'll take the bold action required. So let's keep going.
<02> Our plan to deliver better health and social care
<02> Since 2010, we have invested more in the NHS than at any other point in its history. We will continue to increase NHS spending above inflation in each year of the next Parliament.
<02> During Covid, we saw the NHS at its finest, with extraordinary acts of service and sacrifice from health and care professionals. Throughout the pandemic, the Conservative Government acted to save lives, protect the NHS and deliver a world leading vaccine programme. But dealing with a once-in-a-generation pandemic put a strain on our health and social care system and it has taken time to recover.
<02> Thanks to record funding, we now have
<02> more doctors and nurses than ever before, delivering record numbers of appointments.
<02> We are committed to accelerating the NHS’s recovery from the pandemic, delivering safe and effective services and ongoing improvements
<02> in waiting times for primary, elective, cancer and emergency care. We will return performance to the levels set out in the NHS Constitution by the end of the next Parliament.
<02> We will invest in and modernise the NHS. We have taken the long-term decision to train the staff the NHS needs, by backing the NHS’s first ever Long-Term Workforce Plan. By the end of the next Parliament, there will be 92,000 more nurses and 28,000 more doctors in the NHS than in 2023. We are also delivering record increases in training places for other clinicians, such as midwives and paramedics and we
<02> are boosting training places for dentists and other dental care professionals by 40%. We will improve working conditions for all NHS staff.
<02> We are committed to supporting a high-quality and sustainable social care system, building on our additional investment of up to £8.6 billion over the last two years. At the next Spending Review, we will give local authorities a multi-year funding settlement to support social care and will take forward the reforms in our ‘People at the Heart of Care’ White Paper.
<02> We will attract and retain a high-quality care workforce, make reforms to shape the market for older people’s housing and support unpaid carers. We will implement our planned reforms to cap social care costs from October 2025.
<02> We will invest in more and better facilities,
<02> continuing to deliver 40 new hospitals by 2030 and investing proportionately more
<02> in out-of-hospital services over time. We will modernise NHS primary care services and bring health and care closer to patients.
<02> Our Dental Recovery Plan will unlock 2.5 million more NHS dental appointments, through a patient premium to encourage dentists to take on new NHS patients. We will make further reforms to the dental contract to ensure its future sustainability and we will ensure newly qualified dentists have to work in the NHS for a number
<02> of years or pay back their training costs. We will promote good oral health through our ‘Smile for Life’ programme. Rural and coastal communities will be better served through ‘golden hellos’ to encourage dentists to work in these areas, and through new dental vans.
<02> We will further improve access to NHS services across England by training more staff in rural and coastal areas. For the first time the NHS Constitution will reflect the bespoke healthcare needs of rural and coastal communities and the need for the NHS to tailor services accordingly.
<02> Bringing health and care closer to patients
<02> The NHS Long-Term Workforce Plan will help shift care away from hospitals and into local communities. To support this, we will:
<02> ❱ Expand Pharmacy First, including for menopause support, contraception and treatment for chest infections, freeing up 20 million GP appointments a year.
<02> ❱ Build or modernise 250 GP surgeries, focused on areas of new housing growth.
<02> ❱ Build 50 more Community Diagnostic Centres, including in underserved areas, resulting in an additional 2.5 million checks a year.
<02> We will protect and promote patients’ right to choose the NHS service that is right for them. We will grow opportunities for all types of providers - NHS, charity or independent sector - to offer services free of charge to NHS patients, where these meet NHS costs and standards. We will extend patients’ right to choose to more NHS community services over time, including diagnostics, talking therapies and other mental health services. We will fully roll out Martha’s Rule, giving patients the right to a second opinion.
<02> We will support our world-leading life sciences sector, embracing the opportunities provided
<02> by Brexit to pursue nimble and agile regulation, supported by a well-equipped MHRA. We will support research into new treatments, including for Parkinson’s and motor neurone disease and secure more commercial clinical trials. We will remove bureaucratic obstacles to the use of new medicines, such as the NHS Budget Impact Test and will align NHS England’s cost-effectiveness thresholds for new medicines indications with those used by NICE. We will implement a
<02> new medtech pathway so that cost-effective medtech, including AI, is rapidly adopted throughout the NHS.
<02> We will cut waste and bureaucracy in the NHS, reducing the number of managers
<02> by 5,500, releasing £550 million for frontline services and simplifying and streamlining oversight and accountability. We will carefully consider the implications of the review of the whistleblowing framework for the NHS and we will consult on a disbarring regime for NHS managers.
<02> We know that, for most people, poor health comes from living with one or more of six
<02> major health conditions: cancer, heart disease, musculoskeletal disorders, mental ill-health, dementia and respiratory disease. We will publish and implement a Major Conditions Strategy
<02> to prevent these conditions from occurring and ensure those living with them receive the best possible care. We will also take forward our Rare Diseases Action Plan. We will continue to modernise autism and learning disability services.
<02> We will bring forward our landmark Tobacco and Vapes Bill in our first King’s Speech. We will continue to tackle childhood and adult obesity and will legislate to restrict the advertising of products high in fat, salt and sugar. We will gather new evidence on the impact of ultra- processed food to support people to make healthier choices.
<02> We will roll out new digital health checks to 250,000 more people every year, helping to prevent hundreds of strokes and heart attacks. We will take forward the NHS Vaccination Strategy.
<02> We are implementing the HIV Action Plan, which will end new HIV transmissions by 2030. Subject to evaluation, we will expand HIV opt-out testing in emergency departments in England.
<02> Transforming NHS technology and productivity
<02> We will invest £3.4 billion in new technology to transform the NHS for staff and for patients. The NHS Productivity Plan will see NHS productivity grow by 1.9% a year from 2025-26 – unlocking £35 billion of cumulative savings by the end of the decade. We will:
<02> ❱ Make the NHS App the single front door for NHS services. Patients will use the App to access their medical records, order prescriptions, book vaccine appointments, access a digital red book and manage their hospital appointments.
<02> ❱ Use AI to free up doctors’ and nurses’ time for frontline patient care.
<02> ❱ Replace tens of thousands of outdated computers, slashing the 13 million hours in doctors’ and nurses’ time lost to IT issues every year and digitise NHS processes through the Federated Data Platform.
<02> ❱ Fund technology to help clinicians read MRI and CT scans more quickly and accurately, speeding up results for 130,000 patients every year.
<02> ❱ Create new incentives for improved performance, rewarding the best performing providers of care.
<02> We will prioritise women’s health, following
<02> publication of the first ever Women’s Health
<02> Strategy in 2022. To support women further, we will:
<02> ❱ Bring forward a comprehensive national strategy for maternity care as recommended by the APPG on Birth Trauma’s inquiry.
<02> ❱ Deliver additional funding for maternal safety and improve access to mental health services for new mums, improve perinatal pelvic health services to prevent and support women with birth injuries and postnatal appointments dedicated to checking mums, not just their babies.
<02> ❱ Expand women’s health hubs so that every integrated care system has at least one hub up and running.
<02> ❱ Roll out fracture liaison services to every region, reaching 100% coverage by 2030 as osteoporosis disproportionately impacts women.
<02> ❱ Support continued research into disparities in maternity care through the National Institute for Health and Care Research.
<02> We will complete the implementation of
<02> the Cass Review, protecting young people questioning their gender from ideologically- driven care and ensuring that NHS services follow evidence-based best practice. We have already stopped the routine use by the NHS of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria and will legislate to permanently prevent their private prescription and supply.
<02> We will amend the NHS Constitution so that
<02> it recognises every patient’s right to request single-sex accommodation and same-sex intimate care. We will not allow the word ‘woman’ to be erased by health services. Words such as ‘breastfeeding’ and ‘mother’ will not be replaced by ‘chestfeeding’ and ‘birthing parent’.
<02> We will introduce a new licensing scheme
<02> and age limits for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, ensuring services are administered by suitably qualified and trained professionals.
<02> We will maintain the position that assisted dying is
<02> a matter of conscience and will respect the will of Parliament. Debates on assisted dying should never distract from the importance of delivering high- quality palliative care services and we will continue to support children’s and adults’ hospices.
<02> We have made a wholehearted and unequivocal apology, on behalf of successive governments
<02> of all parties, for the infected blood scandal. As one of the last acts of Parliament, legislation was passed that brings the Infected Blood Compensation Authority into existence and we confirmed Sir
<02> Robert Francis as its Interim Chair. We will pay comprehensive compensation to those infected and those affected by this scandal, accepting the principles recommended by the Inquiry. Whatever it costs to deliver the scheme, we will pay it. We will also give a further £210,000 interim payment
<02> to living infected beneficiaries – those registered with existing infected blood support schemes as well as those who register with a support scheme before the final scheme becomes operational and the estates of those who pass away between now and payments being made. A scandal like this must never be allowed to happen again, so we will study the Inquiry’s wide-ranging recommendations and provide a full response to the Inquiry.
<02> Improving mental health support
<02> Mental health should have parity of esteem with physical health. To support children, young people and adults with their mental health, we will:
<02> ❱ Expand coverage of Mental Health Support Teams from 50% to 100% of schools and colleges in England by 2030.
<02> ❱ Open early support hubs for those aged 11-25 in every local community by 2030.
<02> ❱ Increase the planned expansion of NHS Talking Therapies by 50%, supporting people with anxiety, stress and depression.
<02> ❱ Boost the capacity of Individual Placement and Support for Severe Mental Illness by 140,000 places.
<02> ❱ Pass a new law to provide better treatment and support for severe mental health needs in the first session of the next Parliament.
<02> Our plan for safer streets and justice for victims of crime
<02> The Conservatives will always back our brave police and security services with the powers and resources needed to keep our country safe and we will always work to deliver a justice system that is fair to victims and sees offenders repay their debt to society.
<02> Under the Conservatives, violent crime has fallen by 44% since 2010 and neighbourhood crime
<02> is down 48%. Reoffending has fallen from over 30% in 2010 to 25%. We have recruited 20,000 police officers, delivered 6,000 prison places
<02> as part of the largest prison expansion since the Victorian era and deported over 18,000 foreign national offenders since 2019 alone. We will:
<02> ❱ Give every neighbourhood an additional police officer by recruiting 8,000 more police officers to patrol communities and catch criminals in every ward in the country. These full time, fully warranted officers will be dedicated to neighbourhood policing.
<02> ❱ Back the police, by giving officers new powers and tools to catch criminals, including technology like facial recognition and powers to seize knives and track down stolen property. We will always back the police in the lawful and professional use of force, alongside a fair and proportionate accountability system.
<02> ❱ Restore public trust in policing. We will license police officers for specialist roles, as we do already for firearms officers. We will legislate to ensure officers are appropriately vetted during their service and those who fail can be sacked.
<02> We will foster greater collaboration between the National Crime Agency and Counter Terrorism Policing.
<02> We will urgently introduce Martyn’s Law, in tribute to Martyn Hett, who was tragically killed alongside 21 others in the Manchester Arena terrorist attack in 2017. This will ensure premises are better prepared for terrorist attacks by requiring them to take proportionate steps to mitigate risks.
<02> We will toughen up community sentencing by
<02> increasing the use of community payback and electronic tagging, so criminals pay their debt to society and communities witness justice being served. We will fund every police force to roll out Hotspot Policing, which has cut anti-social behaviour by up to 50% in some areas.
<02> We will keep turning the tide against fraudsters. In the last year we have reduced fraud by 13%, including through our new National Fraud Squad with 400 officers now in post. We will ban SIM farms, which are used to send bulk messages for fraudulent texts, and ban cold calls on financial products so fraudsters cannot dupe people into buying fake investments.
<02> Tackling violence against women and girls
<02> We have made violence against women and girls a strategic policing requirement for the first time, making clear to the police that these crimes are as significant as terrorism, serious and organised crime and child sexual abuse.
<02> We have strengthened the law to punish predators with new offences for stalking, controlling or coercive behaviour, non-fatal strangulation and suffocation, sharing of intimate images or ‘revenge porn’, non-consensual taking of images of a woman breastfeeding,
<02> ‘up skirting’ and raised the maximum penalties for harassment. We will legislate to create new offences for spiking, the creation of sexualised deepfake images and taking intimate images without consent.
<02> We will support victims of domestic abuse including through our Domestic Abuse Act, which created a statutory definition of domestic abuse and gave new powers to police and the courts.
<02> We will toughen sentencing for murders that take place within the context of domestic abuse with new aggravating factors, such as if they involve coercive and controlling behaviour or gratuitous attacks. We will introduce a 25-year prison term for domestic murders, regardless of whether a weapon is used. Those who kill their domestic abusers will not face the same starting point. This will be accompanied by a review of homicide sentencing, looking to close loopholes that allow some killers to get off lightly.
<02> We will introduce an aggravating factor for murders that happen in the context of ‘rough sex’, so it is never used as an excuse to get a lighter sentence.
<02> We have increased rape prosecutions by 56% since 2010 and we will ensure rape victims get the justice and support they deserve, with
<02> a new investigatory model for rape for police forces and prosecutors and pre-recorded cross- examination for victims in all Crown courts.
<02> We will carefully consider the recommendations of Baroness Bertin’s Independent Review of Pornography and ensure we have the right safeguards in place to protect against any harmful impacts of the industry.
<02> A justice system that delivers for victims and the public
<02> We will toughen sentencing for the worst offenders. We have already ended Labour’s automatic halfway release for violent and serious sexual offenders. We will make life imprisonment without parole mandatory for more of the most heinous murderers and require rapists and other serious sexual offenders to spend the whole of their sentences behind bars.
<02> We will toughen sentences for knife crime, grooming gangs and assaults against retail workers and combat the ability of serious organised crime gangs to use new technology to harm the public. We will prioritise further measures to crack down on hyper-prolific offenders.
<02> We will empower judges to require offenders to attend hearings or face an increased sentence. We will stand firmly behind the legal doctrine of joint enterprise meaning that those who assist in crimes, from the getaway driver to the weapon supplier, can be held accountable.
<02> We will build four new prisons, completing our programme of 20,000 new prison places by 2030. We will make it easier to build prisons in appropriate places by scrapping legacy EU rules and streamlining the planning system.
<02> We will remove more Foreign National Offenders by increasing removals under the Early Removal Scheme and negotiating more Prisoner Transfer Agreements.
<02> We will maintain the ban on prisoners voting from jail.
<02> We will turn criminals away from the cycle
<02> of reoffending, investing in rehabilitative services such as drug treatment, education and employment. We will deliver our ten-year drugs plan to cut crime and help people rebuild their lives away from crime.
<02> Our Victims and Prisoners Act ensures victims are protected and supported, including that those affected by major disasters such as Hillsborough, the Manchester Arena bombing and the Grenfell Tower fire can get the help they need, when they need it, through a permanent Independent Public Advocate.
<02> We will expand the provision of legal aid at inquests related to major incidents where the Independent Public Advocate is appointed or in the aftermath of terrorist incidents.
<02> We will bring the mandatory reporting provisions of the Criminal Justice Bill into force as soon as possible. We will design a redress scheme for the victims of child sexual abuse in institutional settings that reflects their needs. We will ensure this includes the victims of grooming gangs and make a national apology to grooming gang victims.
<02> We will ensure sex offenders cannot evade justice or conceal their identity by restricting sex offenders from changing their names.
<02> We will cut the Covid court backlog by keeping open Nightingale courtrooms, funding sitting days and investing in court maintenance. And we will continue to digitise court processes and expand the use of remote hearings. We
<02> will match fund 100 criminal law pupillages to speed up justice for victims and will continue
<02> to ensure access to justice through legal aid provision.
<02> We will expand our Pathfinder Courts pilot in family court proceedings and continue mediation vouchers to help more families resolve private law child arrangements without an acrimonious court battle.
<02> We will support our world class legal services sector, including through an Arbitration Bill. We will help individuals and small businesses bring cases against wealthier opponents with legislation to support third party funding of litigation.
<02> A plan to counter extremism and to protect our streets
<02> In recent months we have seen shocking increases in protests being used as a cover for extremist disruption and criminality. We cannot allow a small and vocal minority to destroy our democratic values. That is why we unveiled a new extremism definition under which certain groups that promote an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance will be blocked from government funding and meeting officials.
<02> We have passed tough new laws to curb disruptive protests. Our Public Order Act 2023 gave the police new powers to intervene where protests cause serious disruption to communities, leading to the arrests of over 600 Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion protestors in London alone. We will introduce further powers to ban face coverings, pyrotechnics and climbing on war memorials.
<02> We will strengthen police powers to prevent protests or marches that pose a risk of serious disorder, by allowing police to take into account the cumulative impact of protests. We will ban protests outside schools to stop mobs from intimidating teachers and children. We will always support teachers to uphold
<02> and promote fundamental British values and ensure they are protected from accusations of blasphemy.
<02> We will place a duty on the police and prosecutors to publish regular guidance on the statements, chants or symbols, for example, the swastika or the term ‘jihad’, that in the context of political protest may constitute an offence. We will explore ways for the police to recover some of the costs of policing disruptive protests from the groups that organise them.
<02> We will also ensure our elected representatives get the protection needed to represent their constituents without fear.
<02> Abuse or discrimination based on religion is unacceptable. We will not tolerate antisemitic hatred in any form. We have pledged £54 million for the Community Security Trust to give Jewish schools and synagogues the security measures they need and allocated additional funding to support schools and universities to understand, recognise and tackle antisemitism. We will get the UK Holocaust Memorial built.
<02> We do not tolerate anti-Muslim hatred and will seek to stamp it out wherever it occurs. We have committed to provide £117 million
<02> over four years for the Protective Security for Mosques scheme and are proud to support and help fund Tell MAMA’s vital work.
<02> Our plan for an affordable and pragmatic transition to net zero
<02> In the last few years, we have faced the greatest shock to our energy security since the 1970s. Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices spiralling. Because of the decisions we had taken to boost domestic energy production and invest
<02> in renewables, Britain had little reliance on Russian fuel when the invasion began, unlike some of our European neighbours. But when global energy prices spiked, the Government stepped in to pay around half the typical household bill at the peak, saving families £1,500 on average. Bills are now coming down, and in July will fall to the lowest level in over two years. But the shock has reminded us
<02> of the importance of securing our long-term energy supply.
<02> We are proud of our record and remain committed to delivering net zero by 2050. Today the UK is home to the five largest offshore
<02> wind farms in the world. Half of our electricity comes from renewables, compared to just
<02> 7% when Labour were last in office. We have reduced emissions further and faster than any
<02> of our competitors and the UK is the first major economy to get halfway to net zero. And we have done this while growing our economy
<02> by 80%, demonstrating to other countries that there is a positive economic path to tackling climate change.
<02> Delivering energy security
<02> We will boost our energy independence in an increasingly unstable world. We will legislate to ensure annual licensing rounds for oil and gas production from our own North Sea to provide energy to homes and businesses across the country and protect high-skilled and well-paid jobs in the industry.
<02> Labour are committed to shutting down the North Sea, rejecting any new licenses. That would put 200,000 jobs and billions of pounds of tax receipts at risk. It would leave the UK more dependent on foreign powers and mean higher emissions from imported liquefied gas.
<02> We introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in 2022 to ensure they pay their fair share of tax from extraordinary profits while prices remain abnormally high. We will keep this in place until 2028-29, unless prices fall back to normal sooner. In total, this is expected to raise over £26 billion. We will maintain the investment allowances that provide incentives to invest in our North Sea, which Labour have said they would remove.
<02> We will back up renewables and prevent the prospect of blackouts with new gas power stations to maintain a safe and reliable energy source for days when the weather doesn’t power up renewables. Conservatives know that if we are forced to choose between clean energy and keeping citizens safe and warm, we will choose to keep the lights on.
<02> We are delivering record investment into UK renewables. But we need to go further, unlocking more investment to secure our energy supply in the future. In the next Parliament we will:
<02> ❱ Treble our offshore wind capacity, to deliver low-cost, home-grown energy and support the development of vibrant industrial clusters in places like the North East of England, Scotland and Wales.
<02> ❱ Build the first two carbon capture and storage clusters, based across North Wales and, the North West of England and Teesside and the Humber, cutting carbon and creating tens of thousands of jobs in these regions, and progress the second tranche of projects in Aberdeenshire and the Humber.
<02> ❱ Invest £1.1 billion into the Green Industries Growth Accelerator to support British manufacturing capabilities, boost supply chains and ensure our energy transition is made in Britain.
<02> ❱ Scale up nuclear power, building on our work establishing Great British Nuclear. Within the first 100 days of the next Parliament, we will approve two new fleets of Small Modular Reactors to rapidly expand nuclear power, create well-paid, high-skilled jobs and deliver cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy. We will halve the time it takes for new nuclear reactors to be approved, by allowing regulators to assess projects while designs are being finalised, improving join-up with overseas regulators assessing the same technology and speeding up planning and environmental approvals.
<02> ❱ Deliver a new gigawatt power plant at Wylfa in North Wales and work with industry to deliver existing projects at Hinkley Point and Sizewell.
<02> This will help the UK to become a net exporter of electricity. And by building more electricity links with neighbouring countries, we can increase exports, make our energy system more efficient and bring additional revenue to the UK. We will ensure offshore cables help reduce the amount of onshore infrastructure, such as substations, that we need to build.
<02> As we achieve this transition to net zero, we will take steps to ensure the technology and infrastructure is made here in the UK. We will provide a bonus, on top of contract payments that support offshore wind, to reward energy firms that invest in manufacturing in the most disadvantaged places in the UK or invest in more sustainable supply chains, creating more good jobs as we get more energy from renewables.
<02> We are strong supporters of domestic steel production and have introduced effective safeguards against steel that is heavily subsidised by foreign governments and helped public projects procure more UK-made steel. We agreed a £500 million grant as part of
<02> a £1.25 billion commitment by Tata Steel to transform and secure a sustainable future
<02> at their Port Talbot works. We will continue working to support production in Scunthorpe and the North East of England, securing the future of steelmaking across the UK.
<02> We will implement a new import carbon pricing mechanism by 2027 to ensure that imports of iron, steel, aluminium, ceramics and cement from countries with a lower or no carbon price will face a comparable carbon price to those goods produced in the UK. This will reduce the risk of industry being displaced to other countries which aren’t taking action on climate change.
<02> A pragmatic and proportionate approach to net zero
<02> The UK has led the world on tackling climate change, having cut our emissions more than any other major economy. We will get to net zero on the fairest possible path and in a way that brings people with us.
<02> We will seize the opportunities created by the transition, opening up whole new sectors and creating hundreds of thousands of good jobs in all corners of the country. Our approach leverages the innovation and investment of the private sector to unleash technologies that cut costs for households. This has enabled
<02> us to overachieve on our targets, become a powerhouse in clean technologies, and continue to support households. We reject Labour’s dogmatic, top-down approach that will burden households with higher bills.
<02> We will cut the cost of tackling climate change for households and business, and deliver net zero by 2050, by:
<02> ❱
<02> Sticking to our pragmatic, proportionate and realistic approach that eases the burdens on working people. Ensuring that families are given time to make changes that affect their lives and never forcing people to rip out their existing boiler and replace it with a heat pump.
<02> ❱ Guaranteeing a vote in the next Parliament on the next stage of our pathway, with adoption of any new target accompanied by proper consideration of the plans and policies required to meet the target, to maintain democratic consent for the big decisions that net zero will mean for our country.
<02> ❱ Ensuring that green levies on household bills are lower. The cost of renewables such as wind and solar has fallen dramatically. We will ensure the annual policy costs and levies on household energy bills are lower in each year of the next Parliament than they were in 2023.
<02> ❱ Reforming the Climate Change Committee, giving it an explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security in its future climate advice.
<02> ❱ Ruling out creating further green levies, and alongside our commitment not to introduce road pricing schemes, we will also rule out any frequent flyer levy.
<02> Energy bills are falling, down 63% since the peak. We will take further action to ensure they are low as possible for families, by:
<02> ❱ Maintaining our energy price cap, protecting millions of households from being overcharged by their supplier. As the energy market advances, the price cap will need to evolve and we will ensure the regulator has the necessary powers to continue protecting consumers.
<02> ❱ Reviewing and reforming standing charges to keep them as low as possible.
<02> ❱ Delivering our Pumpwatch scheme that will force petrol retailers to share live information on their prices, helping drivers to get a fair price at the pump.
<02> ❱ Introducing more efficient local markets for electricity, which expert analysis estimates would save £20 - £45 per household per year.
<02> ❱ Giving households the choice of smart energy tariffs, which can save them £900 a year.
<02> ❱ Implementing the recommendations of the Winser Review, ensuring networks are able to buy forward with confidence and cutting waiting times to get a grid connection to deliver an estimated saving of £15 - £25 per household per year out to 2035.
<02> ❱ Recognising technological developments over the last decade, we will undertake
<02> a rapid review into the advantages of alternative network technologies, compared to overhead pylons. The review will consider moving to a presumption in favour of undergrounding where cost competitive.
<02> Almost half of homes in England are now energy efficiency Band C, up from just one in seven in 2010. We will invest £6 billion in energy efficiency over the next three years to make around a million homes warmer. And we will fund an energy efficiency voucher scheme, open to every household in England, to support the installation of energy efficiency measures and solar panels, helping families lower their bills.
<02> We will ensure democratic consent for onshore wind, striking the right balance between energy security and the views of their local communities. Our updated National Planning Policy Framework seeks to ensure local areas that host onshore wind directly benefit, including potentially through energy bill discounts.
<02> We will support solar in the right places, not
<02> on our best agricultural land. We have changed planning rules to protect the best agricultural
<02> land with a presumption that this is used for food production, while also making it easier for solar to be located on brownfield sites and on rooftops. Our new planning rules also prevent multiple solar farms being clustered in one area to help protect our rural landscapes. We will retain the current moratorium on fracking.
<02> Our plan to build more houses in the right places
<02> We will deliver a secure future for communities by giving more people a better chance of living where they would like – near their family, friends and job. We have delivered over 2.5 million homes since 2010, including meeting our commitment to deliver one million homes in the last Parliament. Home ownership rates plummeted under the last Labour Government so we cannot afford to go back to square one. We will deliver 1.6 million homes in England in the next Parliament by:
<02> ❱ Abolishing the legacy EU ‘nutrient neutrality’ rules to immediately unlock the building of 100,000 new homes with local consent, with developers required in law to pay a one-off mitigation fee so there is no net additional pollution.
<02> ❱ Delivering a record number of homes each year on brownfield land in urban areas. We will do this by providing a fast- track route through the planning system for new homes on previously developed land in the 20 largest cities. Strong design codes will ensure this enables the gentle densification of urban areas, with new family homes and mansion-blocks on tree- lined streets built in the local character. We will look at extending ‘full expensing’ to the delivery of brownfield housing.
<02> ❱ Raising density levels in inner London to those of European cities like Paris and Barcelona. We will ensure the London Plan delivers more family homes a year, forcing the Mayor to plan for more homes on brownfield sites, like underused industrial land. We will regenerate major sites like Euston, Old Oak Common and Thamesmead.
<02> ❱Unlocking new urban regeneration schemes, by creating locally-led urban development corporations in partnership with the private sector and institutional investors. We will support the delivery of new quarters in Leeds, Liverpool and York alongside working with local leaders and the community to seize the opportunity of our ambitious Cambridge 2050 plan.
<02> ❱Supporting local and smaller builders
<02> by requiring councils to set land aside for them and lifting Section 106 burdens on more smaller sites, while ruling out Labour’s proposed ‘community right to appeal’ which would bring the planning system to its knees.
<02> ❱Making sure local authorities use the new Infrastructure Levy to deliver the GP surgeries, roads and other local infrastructure needed to support homes. We will not allow these funds to be spent on community projects that bear no relation to support for new homes.
<02> ❱Renewing the Affordable Homes Programme that will deliver homes of all tenures and focus on regenerating and improving housing estates.
<02> ❱Retaining our cast-iron commitment to protect the Green Belt from uncontrolled development, while ensuring more homes get built where it makes sense, like in inner cities. Our national planning protections mean there is never any top-down requirement for councils to remove Green Belt protection and these will remain in place.
<02> A plan to support first-time buyers onto the housing ladder and ensure fairness in our housing system
<02> As well as building the homes we need, we
<02> will also take immediate steps to support more people onto the housing ladder. We will ensure the majority of first-time buyers pay no Stamp Duty at all, lowering the upfront costs of buying a first home. We will make permanent the increase to the threshold at which first-time buyers pay Stamp Duty to £425,000 from £300,000, which we introduced in 2022. We will also launch a new and improved Help to Buy scheme to provide first-time buyers with an equity loan of up to 20% towards the cost of a new build home. First-time buyers will be able to get onto the housing ladder with a 5% deposit on interest terms they can afford. The scheme will be part funded by contributions from house builders. We will also continue
<02> our Mortgage Guarantee Scheme, which has already helped over 40,000 households buy
<02> a home, while supporting more families to buy through shared ownership.
<02> We will always prioritise giving those who work hard and contribute to our country a leg up in the housing market. We will legislate for new ‘Local Connection’ and ‘UK Connection’ tests for social housing in England, to ensure this valuable but limited resource is allocated fairly. And we will implement a ‘three strikes and you’re out’ expectation of social housing landlords for anti-social behaviour. They will be expected to evict tenants whose behaviour is disruptive to neighbours and the local community.
<02> We will protect family homes from higher tax. Under the Family Home Tax Guarantee, we will not increase the number of council tax bands, undertake an expensive council tax revaluation or cut council tax discounts, as Labour is currently doing in Wales. We will maintain Private Residence Relief so that people’s homes are protected from Capital Gains Tax and we will not increase the rate or level of Stamp Duty to support homeowners.
<02> To further support homeowners, we will introduce a two-year temporary Capital Gains Tax relief for landlords who sell to their existing tenants. We rule out Labour’s anti-aspiration move to drastically reduce Right to Buy discounts to levels seen under the last Labour Government. We will protect the laws that ensure the discounts rise with inflation and fight any plan by local authorities to abolish the Right to Buy altogether.
<02> We will complete the process of leasehold reform, to improve the lives of over four million leaseholders. We will cap ground rents at £250, reducing them to peppercorn over time. We will end the misuse of forfeiture so leaseholders don’t lose their property and capital unfairly and make it easier to take up commonhold.
<02> We will pass a Renters Reform Bill that will deliver fairness in the rental market for landlords and renters alike. We will deliver the court reforms necessary to fully abolish Section 21 and strengthen other grounds for landlords to evict private tenants guilty of anti-social behaviour.
<02> We will continue with our plans to end rough sleeping and prevent people from ending up on the streets in the first place, after making significant progress over the last few years. We will deliver our commitments under the Local Authority Housing Fund and review the quality of temporary accommodation.
<02> After delivering landmark new laws that freed leaseholders from cladding bills following on from the awful tragedy of Grenfell Tower, we will continue our support for leaseholders affected by historic building safety problems by requiring the continuation of developer- funded remediation programmes for mid- and high-rise buildings.
<02> We will ensure councils have the powers they need to manage the uncontrolled growth of holiday lets, which can cause nuisance to local residents and a hollowing out of communities.
<02> We will support those who want to build or commission their own home by making the planning process simpler, while also supporting more community housing schemes. We will encourage the building of different forms of housing, particularly housing for older people.
<02> Building on our new powers for the police, we will further speed up the use and enforcement of powers to remove illegal traveller sites, while giving councils greater planning powers to prevent unauthorised development by travellers.
<02> Our plan to strengthen communities
<02> Our commitment to levelling
<02> up means giving everyone the opportunity to stay local and go
<02> far. Conservatives are committed to delivering stronger communities and safer streets, unleashing the power of the private sector to unlock jobs and opportunity for
<02> all and boosting local pride. We have already allocated and will ensure we deliver over £15 billion in dedicated levelling up funding across the UK since 2019 and passed our landmark Levelling
<02> Up and Regeneration Act. We
<02> have saved more than 330 pubs, sports clubs, arts venues and
<02> other precious community spaces through our Community Ownership Fund and we have unlocked the promise of thousands of jobs with 12 Freeports. To further strengthen communities, we will:
<02> ❱ Provide 105 towns in the UK with a £20 million endowment fund for local people to change their town’s future. This includes extending our plan to 30 more towns who will benefit from funding that they can use on their priorities such as reviving high streets or bringing new housing to town centres.
<02> ❱ Extend our Community Ownership Fund to help more communities across the UK take control of vital community assets like pubs, music venues, libraries, green spaces, leisure centres and more.
<02> ❱ Extend the UK Shared Prosperity Fund for three years at the next Spending Review, before using this funding to support UK- wide National Service. Both schemes will involve funding community groups focused on increasing life chances, instilling civic pride and boosting people’s skills.
<02> ❱Create more Freeports and Business Rates Retention zones. Freeports have already generated just under £3 billion
<02> in investment, which in turn will create thousands of jobs. We will extend this opportunity to more areas and set out an application round in the next Parliament. We want to replicate the example of Sunderland’s Crown Works Studios elsewhere in the country. We will enable councils to retain all business rates growth within a defined zone for 25 years, which they can use to finance the delivery of new infrastructure and invest in supporting burgeoning local industries.
<02> ❱Continue backing Investment Zones across the country, giving areas £160 million to catalyse local growth and investment.
<02> ❱Give our high streets a new lease of
<02> life and restore pride in place. We will change planning laws to support places to bring back local market days and regenerate defunct shopping centres. We will continue to make industry pay for removing chewing-gum from streets and raise the fines utility firms must pay when they create ‘street scars’ by not properly restoring roads and pavements after their works are completed. We will make fly tipping an offence that carries penalty points against your driving licence.
<02> ❱Empower communities through devolution and new powers. By 2030, every part
<02> of England that wants one will have a devolution deal. We will offer our ‘level 4’ devolution powers to areas in England with a devolution deal and a directly elected leader, starting with the Tees Valley.
<02> ❱Launch a Seaside Heritage Fund to support enhancements to our seaside heritage, preserving and restoring our coastal assets.
<02> We will ensure councils provide high quality and value for money services to local communities. As part of this, we will protect residents from excessive council tax rises by ensuring that local people have the final say on council tax; and we will ban the ‘four-day working week’ in local authorities. We will improve standards in councils by making their performance more transparent through the Office for Local Government. We will always stand behind councils and look to recognise the unique circumstances of coastal areas
<02> in the allocation of grant funding to local authorities, alongside providing fairer funding for rural areas through the Rural Services Delivery Grant.
<02> A plan to support the journeys people make every day
<02> Reliable transport links are critical for thriving local communities. The £36 billion of savings from HS2 will transform local and regional transport, benefitting more people, in more places, more quickly. But we will also take immediate steps to help people now. Buses are overwhelmingly the most popular form of public transport, in both urban and rural areas. Our £2 bus fare has cut bus fares outside London by 6.2%. We will extend the £2 bus fare cap in England for the entirety of the next Parliament, benefitting young people and low-income households while pensioners continue to benefit from the free bus pass. The extension of the £2 fare cap will be funded by savings from reform of the railway which will save up to £1.5 billion annually.
<02> Too often over the last few years, local Labour politicians have made the journeys on which people rely harder. We are determined to
<02> turn this situation around. Since 2010, the Conservative Government has consistently been on the side of drivers. We have prioritised freezes in Fuel Duty and recently published our ‘Plan for Drivers’ including reforms to make better use of bus lanes, introduce penalties
<02> for overrunning street works and implement a consistent approach to the enforcement of entering yellow box junctions. Following the recent consultation, we will allow motorcycles in all bus lanes and reform motorcycle licensing.
<02> We will roll out the National Parking Platform this year to simplify paying for parking. Reflecting feedback from older and disabled people, we will also give councils the power to ban pavement parking, provided they engage with businesses and residents to ensure they are not adversely affected.
<02> We remain steadfastly committed to road safety and, to that end, will maintain our pledge to build no new smart motorways and invest in improving the safety of existing ones.
<02> Backing drivers
<02> In our first King’s Speech, we will go even further and introduce a Backing Drivers Bill that will:
<02> ❱ Stop road pricing. A Conservative Government will not introduce pay per mile road pricing and will ban Mayors and local councils from doing so.
<02> ❱ Reverse Labour’s unfair ULEZ expansion in London. Sadiq Khan’s ULEZ tax rise only has a ‘moderate’ or ‘minor’ effect on pollution. The expansion impacts thousands of people living around London who had no say in his election and can now no longer afford to get to hospital appointments or where they work or study. We will reverse it.
<02> ❱ Rule out top-down blanket Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and 20mph zones. While 20mph zones can help improve road safety in residential areas or outside schools, misuse undermines public trust and risks congestion and pollution. We are clear they must only be considered on a road-by-road basis and with the support of people who live there. We will require any new schemes to be put to a referendum and introduce a ‘right to challenge’ existing Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and 20mph schemes.
<02> 2025 marks the 200th anniversary of the
<02> first passenger railway in the UK and we are the only party with a credible plan for rail reform. Labour’s incoherent and ideological nationalisation plan would put the trade unions in charge, continuing to prolong unaffordable and unfair working practices which are unjustifiable to the public.
<02> We will introduce a Rail Reform Bill in our first King’s Speech to create Great British Railways (GBR), headquartered in Derby. GBR will usher in a revitalised private-public partnership, delivering a modern and innovative railway with reliable services, and simpler tickets. We will task GBR with growing the role of the private sector, including supporting the expansion of open access services to bring greater choice for passengers. We will also look to include measures to reform outdated working practices in the rail industry in the Rail Reform Bill.
<02> Over the next Parliament, we will also roll
<02> out mobile pay as you go contactless tickets nationwide, bringing rail into line with how we pay for many goods and services.
<02> We will work with Active Travel England to make it safer for people to walk or cycle, including projects like ensuring safe walking routes to schools and measures to protect pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users. Where new schemes are introduced, we will ensure they have local support first. While we back responsible cyclists, we will bring penalties for the rare instances where dangerous cyclists kill or injure into line with those for other road users.
<02> Protecting our heritage and institutions
<02> The Conservative Party will always protect
<02> our national heritage – including statues, monuments and memorials. We will keep
<02> our ‘retain and explain’ guidance under
<02> review to ensure it supports custodians in
<02> the preservation of our national history and heritage. We will continue to support museums and libraries across the country. Government has the power to leverage philanthropy for good causes and cultural institutions. We will work with individuals, businesses, charities and other networks to find opportunities to unleash this even further. We will complete the review of Gift Aid within the next Parliament.
<02> We will ensure Royal Mail continues to deliver the universal postal service in a way which
<02> is affordable for customers as well as being efficient and financially sustainable. Saturday deliveries are important, particularly to businesses, which is why we are clear they will not be scrapped. Conservatives are clear we want a continued six-day service, which Labour and the trade unions would put at risk.
<02> We have taken exceptional and unprecedented action, legislating to quash the convictions
<02> of those affected by the Post Office Horizon scandal, one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history. We will ensure the new redress scheme is in place and ready to make payments to claimants by the end of July. We are clear that the Post Office should be a valuable social and economic asset for communities and businesses for years to come. That requires a change of culture at the top to deliver the scale of change needed across the organisation.
<02> We have legislated to require banks and building societies considering closing a branch to consider the needs of all their customers and ensure they continue to have appropriate access to cash in their local community. We have already announced over 100 Banking Hubs which enable customers to access free to use cash and everyday banking services.
<02> We remain steadfast in our support for the
<02> fundamental principles that underpin the UK’s constitutional settlement. We remain committed to the First Past the Post system for elections, maintaining the direct link with the local voter. We will not change the voting age from 18. We will maintain rules to tackle voting fraud, including the requirement to show ID.
<02> Our plan for greater protections around sex and gender
<02> Biological sex is a reality. The overwhelming majority of people in this country recognise that. It is right that we have in place provisions and protections for those whose sense of self does not match their biological sex. However, we will not allow the safety and privacy of women and girls to be undermined.
<02> It has been more than a decade since
<02> the Equality Act was passed by a Labour Government. It has not kept pace with evolving interpretations and is not sufficiently clear
<02> on when it means sex and when it means gender. The next Conservative Government will introduce primary legislation to clarify that the protected characteristic of sex
<02> in the Equality Act means biological sex.
<02> This will guarantee that single sex services
<02> and single sex spaces can be provided, for example in healthcare and sports settings, to ensure women and girls are protected. We are clear that on fundamental matters of personal identity there should be one approach across the country, so we will also legislate so that an individual can only have one sex in the eyes of the law in the United Kingdom.
<02> In recent years, an increasing number of children have started questioning their gender, the consequences of which are still unknown. This is why we will pass legislation to ensure schools must follow our guidance for teachers on how best to support gender questioning students in schools and colleges. Parents will have a right to know if their child wants to be treated as the opposite sex and schools will have to involve parents when it comes to decisions about their children.
<02> We are clear that no one in this country should be harmed or harassed for who they are. That is why we are proud that the UK has one of the world’s strongest legislative frameworks
<02> to prevent and tackle discrimination and harassment against those with particular protected characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender reassignment. Attempts at so-called ‘conversion therapy’ are abhorrent. But legislation around conversion practices
<02> is a very complex issue, with existing criminal law already offering robust protections. The challenges involved can be seen, for example, with the SNP re-consulting for views on their proposals in Scotland and Sweden recently concluding that they will not be pursuing a similar ban. In light of the Cass Review Final Report, it is right that we take more time before reaching a final judgement on additional legislation in this area.
<02> Equality of opportunity
<02> We are committed to promoting equality of opportunity, not divisive identity politics. We value a society that is inclusive no matter what sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity or religion a person is. Our United Kingdom is a multi- ethnic, multi-racial, multi-faith success story. Our Inclusive Britain plan advances opportunity while tackling unfair ethnic disparities across education, employment, health and the justice system. We are seeing some of the most entrenched disparities in our society narrowing, for example in our justice system and our police forces, we now have the highest proportion of ethnic minority officers, judges and magistrates since records began.
<02> Our ambition is to make this country the most accessible place in the world for people
<02> with disabilities to live, work and thrive. We are delivering on our Disability Action Plan to transform the everyday lives of people with disabilities. We passed the British Sign Language Act to ensure all public services and information are accessible to Deaf people who use BSL. The Down Syndrome Act will improve access to services and the quality of life of people with Down’s syndrome. In the next Parliament we will improve support for people who have guide or assistance dogs and explore bidding to host and deliver the 2031 Special Olympics World Summer Games.
<02> We are proud of our record on delivering for LGBT people and will continue to do so. We passed the Same Sex Marriage Act to give same-sex couples the opportunity to enjoy the institution of marriage. We have delivered the largest national roll out of PrEP in Europe.
<02> Our plan to back farmers and fisheries to grow our food security
<02> Our food and farming sectors generate over £120 billion for the UK economy every year. In the
<02> last Parliament, we maintained
<02> the farming budget to support our food security. In England, this has supported farmers with a range of options to choose what works best for them, from business advice to new equipment, soil and nutrient management and hedgerow planting. Labour’s actions in Wales show that they will never be on the side of the farming community. Their blueprint involves top-down targets, fundamentally denying farmers the flexibility they need
<02> to achieve environmental goals in ways that work for them and making their primary job of keeping the nation fed harder. Conservatives will always be on the side of farmers.
<02> To continue backing our farmers, we will:
<02> ❱ Increase the UK-wide farming budget
<02> by £1 billion over the Parliament,
<02> ensuring it rises by inflation in every year. Farmers will be able to spend every
<02> extra penny on grants to boost domestic food production on top of maintaining
<02> our approach to Environmental Land Management Schemes. In England, nearly half of all farmers have now signed up to schemes, choosing what works best for their business to invest in food security and sustainable agriculture. We will build on work to date to ensure our schemes work for all farmers, from tenants to the uplands and beyond.
<02> ❱ Continue to ringfence agricultural funding so it is passed directly on to farming and rural communities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland alongside a new UK-wide £20 million Farming Innovation Fund.
<02> ❱ Introduce a legally binding target to enhance our food security. The target
<02> will apply UK-wide alongside our UK Food Security Index, the first of its kind, helping us to determine where best to concentrate farming funds. This will also feed into the development of the Land Use Framework.
<02> ❱ Improve public sector procurement to deliver our goal that at least 50% of food expenditure is spent on food produced locally or to higher environmental production standards.
<02> ❱ Reform our planning system to deliver fast track permissions for the building of infrastructure on farms, such as glasshouses, slurry and grain stores, and small-scale reservoirs.
<02> ❱ Use our significant investment in R&D to prioritise cutting-edge technology in areas such as fertiliser and vertical farming.
<02> ❱ Stick to our plan to support the agricultural sector with the labour it needs to maintain our food security, while moving away from the reliance on seasonal migrant labour with a five-year visa tapered scheme, alongside clear investment in automation and promoting agri-food careers and skills.
<02> ❱ Always stand up for farmers when negotiating new trade deals. At the 2023 UK Farm to Fork Summit, an event which we will continue every year, we set out our commitments to ensure UK farming is at the heart of UK trade. We will always look for the right deal for farmers. We will continue to support UK agri-food and drink attachés in our embassies abroad, pioneering new markets and new opportunities for our domestic food and drink industry.
<02> Championing our fishing sector
<02> We have taken back control of our waters post-Brexit and will continue to back our fishing sector to feed the nation, build long term sustainability, and grow coastal businesses from Shetland to Cornwall. In 2024, we secured quotas worth over £970 million for UK fishermen. We will go further to seek additional opportunities for our inshore fleet in the 2026 negotiations, and ensure inshore voices are better heard by their representative bodies.
<02> We will replicate the £100 million UK Seafood Fund to continue to support the sector to thrive. The fund could be used to invest in harbour and fish market upgrades, provide new equipment and technology for fish processing or to support our growing aquaculture sector. We will particularly concentrate funding on small and medium sized businesses and the inshore fishing fleet. Recognising competing pressure on marine space, we will also seek opportunities to back the inshore fleet when making marine planning decisions.
<02> Our plan to support our rural way of life and enhance our environment
<02> Conservatives are committed to nurturing a thriving rural economy. Rural areas already contribute over £250 billion to the economy. We will build on this, supporting jobs, growth and education in rural communities.
<02> Over 80% of properties across the country can now access high-speed broadband, up from just 7% in 2019, with a record £714 million committed to boosting rural broadband coverage in 2024. We will invest in new technology to achieve our ambitious broadband targets for hard-to-reach areas. On transport, the £2 fare cap has cut rural bus fares by over 11% and our commitment in our Backing Drivers Bill not to introduce pay per mile road pricing schemes will ensure people who rely on their cars in rural areas are protected.
<02> We will do more to boost the availability of affordable housing for local people in rural areas. We will ensure rural exception sites support local people into home ownership and create a dedicated taskforce in Homes England to deliver on the mission set out in their Rural Housing Statement to invest in regeneration
<02> and building high quality homes. We will ensure councils have the powers they need to manage the uncontrolled growth of holiday lets, which can cause nuisance to residents and a broader ‘hollowing out’ of communities.
<02> Conservatives will always seek to preserve
<02> and enhance the rural way of life. We will
<02> make no changes to the Hunting Act. Further, public arms-length bodies must be responsive to those they serve. Rural communities are clear that improvements must be made to the ways in which these bodies consult and make decisions, especially from Natural England and the Environment Agency. We will improve their accountability and give them clearer objectives to focus on. They must take balanced decisions and factor in the impact on the rural economy.
<02> In recent years we have seen increasingly extreme wet weather, underlining the importance of building flood resilience. Since 2010, Government investment has better protected over 600,000 properties from flooding and coastal erosion, and since 2015, has protected over 900,000 acres of farmland. In 2020, we announced a doubling of capital funding into flood defences in England to
<02> a record £5.6 billion over 2021-2027. We
<02> will maintain this record flooding funding
<02> to continue to protect homes, farms and businesses. This will work alongside the
<02> Flood Recovery Framework and Farming Recovery Fund to directly support communities, businesses and farmers affected by flooding.
<02> Enhancing nature and protecting our environment
<02> Our beautiful countryside, coastline, woods and rivers are a crucial part of what makes
<02> our country so special. We are committed
<02> to leaving the environment in a better state for future generations. We introduced our landmark Environment Act including ambitious targets to halt nature’s decline by 2030 and Biodiversity Net Gain, a world leading scheme to deliver greener new development. We led international efforts to protect our oceans and seas, building on the success of the Blue Belt programme which protects an area of ocean the size of India. We will consult UK overseas territories on opportunities to expand it further.
<02> We will continue with our moratorium on deep sea mining and will ratify the Global Oceans Treaty early in the next Parliament. We have prioritised animal welfare, passing legislation to protect pets from harm whilst ensuring owners are responsible and cracking down on dangerous dogs such as XL Bullies. We remain committed to banning the import of hunting trophies and tackling puppy smuggling and livestock worrying.
<02> Water supply interruptions to customers have decreased five-fold and leakage has been cut by one-third since privatisation. Last year 90% of our designated bathing waters were classified as ‘good’ or ‘excellent’, up from 76% in 2010. But we must go further. That is why we set out an ambitious Plan for Water, bringing historic levels of transparency and investment, while keeping bill increases affordable for consumers. Our plan includes:
<02> ❱ Working with the regulator to further
<02> hold companies to account, including banning executive bonuses if a company has committed a serious criminal breach. This will build on our legislation for unlimited fines.
<02> ❱ Extending the £50 water rebate for those in the South West across the Parliament.
<02> ❱ Using fines from water companies to invest in river restoration projects, including linking up thriving habitats to multiply the benefits for wildlife and water quality. This will create a river recovery network, modelled on our nature recovery network, and create new destinations for people to enjoy across England. It will take a more local, tailored approach like the plan for the River Wye.
<02> The next five years will see transformational investment and change in the water sector
<02> on a scale never seen before, thanks to the introduction of 100% monitoring – up from
<02> 7% under the last Labour Government – and targets on leaks and pollution. To deliver our ambitious plan for water beyond 2030, we will reform the ‘Price Review’ regulatory process for water companies. This will consider how we move to a more localised catchment-based and outcome-focussed approach, that better utilises nature-based solutions and further strengthens sanctions for water companies that fail to deliver for the public, coasts and rivers.
<02> We are sticking to our ambitious plan to plant more trees. We will:
<02> ❱ Deliver our tree planting and peatland commitments through our Nature for Climate funding, and continuing our work to unlock private investment.
<02> ❱ Launch a new design competition for urban greening, focused on the new quarters we want to develop in Leeds, Cambridge and sites in inner London.
<02> ❱ Cut red tape that holds back the planting of trees in the planning system. This will identify particularly suitable areas for tree planting where processes and permits will be streamlined.
<02> ❱ Deliver our commitment at COP28 to introduce forest risk commodities legislation early in the next Parliament, tackling our impact on illegal deforestation internationally.
<02> We know that spending time outdoors in nature can significantly benefit our health and wellbeing, especially for children. That is why we set an ambitious commitment for everyone to have access to nature within 15 minutes’ walk of where they live. To deliver this, we will:
<02> ❱ Designate our 11th National Park alongside investing to improve existing National Parks and protected landscapes.
<02> ❱ Use future rounds of our Landscape Recovery Scheme to support more local projects like the community-led schemes near Hadrian’s Wall as the area recovers from the vandalism at the Sycamore Gap.
<02> ❱ Continue to support programmes that encourage disadvantaged children and young people to access green spaces.
<02> ❱ Deliver our commitments on National Trails including the Coast to Coast Path and the King Charles III England Coast Path.
<02> ❱ Continue to work with landowners, charities and others to open up more ‘access to nature’ routes. We will not impose a universal Right to Roam.
<02> We will take comprehensive action to crack down on organised waste crime, especially those who impact protected nature sites. We will deliver our enhanced penalties for
<02> fly tipping, giving councils new tools to help tackle offenders. We will continue to develop
<02> a UK-wide Deposit Return Scheme, while working to minimise the impact on businesses and consumers. We will prevent new waste incinerators being built, including those with recent permit approvals, revoking those
<02> where substantial construction has not taken place. This recognises the impact on local communities and that increased recycling rates will reduce the need for incineration capacity in the longer term.
<02> Our plan to support sport and the creative sector
<02> At the core of our national and local identities is culture and sport.
<02> We are proud of our investment in grassroots sports across the country, with over £320 million being delivered between 2021 and 2025 to build, renovate and maintain grass pitches and, multi-sport facilities. We will maintain this pace of investment over the next Parliament through the continuation of the Multi-Sport Grassroots Facilities Programme. We will look to expand the criteria to ensure more sports benefit from this investment. We will introduce laws to ensure our fans never again face the threat of clubs in England joining breakaway closed-shop competitions and giving them more of a voice through the Independent Football Regulator.
<02> The Conservative Party stands up for women and girls in sport. We delivered equal access for grassroots sporting facilities for women and girls, the £30 million Lionesses Futures Fund, established the Board of Women’s Sport and are implementing recommendations from the Carney Review of Women’s Football. We will prioritise equal access for women and girls
<02> in our ongoing programme of investment in grassroots sports facilities.
<02> Supporting our world-
<02> leading creative industries
<02> We believe apprenticeships are a key pipeline of talent into our world-leading creative industries. We will work with industry to deliver a dedicated flexible coordination service so that everyone who wants to work in the film, TV, gaming and music sectors can work on live productions whilst benefiting from at least 12 months of secure training.
<02> We will ensure our creative sector tax incentives remain competitive. The UK is now the second most popular place in the world to make
<02> films and high-end TV. That’s a direct result
<02> of Conservatives taking action: there have been 1 million new jobs since 2010 and the economic value of the creative industries has doubled. We provided an unprecedented £1.57 billion support package during Covid. We will ensure creators are properly protected and remunerated for their work, whilst also making the most of the opportunities of AI and its applications for creativity in the future.
<02> As well as standing behind the creative sector we have also stood behind our pubs and hospitality businesses, prioritising them for Business Rates relief and freezing alcohol duty. But, in parts of the country, hospitality and particularly our nighttime economy is in decline. In Wales, Labour have hiked taxes on business by axing tax relief. In London, despite the high profile hiring of a ‘Night Czar’ by the Labour Mayor, over 3,000 pubs, bars and nightclubs have closed in the capital since March 2020. We will turn this around by launching a review of the nighttime economy in England, looking at how to reverse the decline in pubs and clubs and how to make our towns and cities great places to go out.
<02> The BBC should represent the perspectives
<02> of the entire nation with diversity of thought, accuracy and impartiality as its guiding principles. We will carefully consider the findings of the Funding Review ahead of the next Royal Charter and ensure it upholds these principles. We will introduce a new complaints process for the BBC so the BBC does not mark its own homework.
<02> The Conservative Party is a strong defender of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. We oppose state regulation and control of the press, including any attempt to bring forward Leveson 2 or re-open the Royal Charter on self-regulation of the press. We were proud
<02> to deliver the Freedom of Speech Act to protect free speech and open debate in our universities.
<02> Our plan to strengthen the United Kingdom
<02> In recent years, each part of the UK has worked together to tackle shared challenges. The United Kingdom is a unique and uniquely successful Union, enabling each constituent part to grow and thrive. As the Conservative and Unionist Party, we are committed to supporting our Union and continuing to deliver for people across the UK.
<02> During the 25th anniversary year of devolution, we celebrate the progress which has been made and the relationships which have been built. We are focused on working together to deliver for people across the UK, including maintaining meaningful intergovernmental relations. Since the initial devolution settlements, significant further powers have been devolved to Holyrood, Cardiff Bay and Stormont. We believe governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland now have the right balance of powers to deliver for people there.
<02> As powers have been transferred, it has become more important than ever that the devolved governments are held responsible for their performance. To support this, we will legislate to deliver comparable data across the UK so the performance of public services can be accurately compared.
<02> We support greater accountability within
<02> the devolved parliaments and centralisation within Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to ensure decisions are made as close to the communities they serve as possible. Devolved governments should be focused on utilising the powers they have to deliver on people’s priorities and we will continue to oppose attempts to distract from these with constitutional wrangling.
<02> We will relentlessly protect the UK’s internal market, securing Northern Ireland’s place in it and protecting consumers and businesses from unnecessary trade barriers. Intra-UK trade is worth £190 billion, and to boost this, we have legislated to guarantee unfettered access for goods from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK and will establish a new Intertrade UK body to promote trade within the United Kingdom. The UK Internal Market Act ensures businesses can sell goods and provide services freely across the UK.
<02> Levelling up across the UK
<02> Delivering for people right across the country requires joint working between the UK and devolved governments as well as local partners. Our focus on delivery and working with local partners to do so, has paid dividends in recent years, providing:
<02> ❱ over £3 billion of investment in levelling up in Scotland;
<02> ❱ over £2.5 billion to level up Wales; and
<02> ❱ over £1 billion for levelling up projects in
<02> Northern Ireland.
<02> The UK Government has a duty to citizens right across the country. Over the course of the last Parliament we have been building stronger relationships with local authorities and community groups in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to help us deliver for people there. We are committed to continuing to fund projects across the UK directly and will:
<02> ❱ Extend the UK Shared Prosperity Fund for another three years, delivering a further £540 million a year for communities across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<02> ❱ Expand the Long-Term Plan for Towns, supporting a further nine towns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland with £20 million endowments to make long-term improvements over 10 years.
<02> ❱ Maintain the Community Ownership Fund for another three years, enabling community groups across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to continue accessing funding to save community assets which are at risk of being lost.
<02> ❱ Continue the Multi-Sport Grassroots Facilities Programme throughout the next Parliament so sports facilities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can access vital investment.
<02> These schemes improve communities and support infrastructure as well as sports
<02> and cultural activities across the UK, sitting alongside our backing for events such as the Hay Festival, the Edinburgh Festival and Fringe and the UK and Ireland Euro 2028 tournament.
<02> We will support Freeports and investment zones in Scotland and Wales, delivering jobs and investment from the Cromarty Firth to Port Talbot, and establish an Enhanced Investment Zone in Northern Ireland.
<02> We will pursue the extension of the Enhanced Investment Zone to cover Stranraer and Cairnryan on the west coast of Scotland, recognising this vital route between Northern Ireland and Scotland and the opportunities for trade and economic growth.
<02> Our Islands Forum will also continue to bring together island communities from across the UK to consider and identify solutions to their unique needs.
<02> Scotland
<02> Ten years on from the 2014 independence referendum, the SNP remain focused on the constitution while Scotland has moved on. They are distracted from the day job, with falling educational standards, rising drug deaths and long-delayed ferries. The Conservatives and Unionists will continue to oppose this – the 2014 vote was decisive.
<02> Instead, we will focus on what really matters to people.
<02> We will cut taxes for working people again, benefitting 2.4 million Scots. We are also boosting Scotland’s economy through mechanisms such as our City and Growth Deals, dedicated British Business Bank fund and support for Scottish exports. Our new Intertrade UK body will promote trade within the United Kingdom, with 61% of Scotland’s exports going to the rest of the UK in 2021.
<02> We will press for the permanent removal
<02> of tariffs on Scotch whisky with the US Government and work to achieve a significant tariff reduction in India through free trade agreement discussions. Scottish businesses will also continue to benefit from measures including tax reliefs for creative industries, support for small businesses and entrepreneurs and the Global Britian Investment Fund.
<02> We will prioritise our energy security. We have already put the Energy Security Investment Mechanism into legislation, ensuring the energy profits levy will end when oil and gas prices
<02> fall below a threshold. We will bring legislate to require annual oil and gas licensing rounds and maintain investment allowances for the oil and gas sector while supporting renewable technologies.
<02> We will continue backing the North Sea Transition Deal and Aberdeen City Region Deal, with Aberdeen’s Investment Zone bringing £160 million of support to the area over the next ten years. We will focus on supporting Scotland’s workforce transition to new industries such as carbon capture, offshore wind, hydrogen and tidal, including by providing £15 million
<02> to support the Energy Transition Zone’s skills programmes. We will continue laying the groundwork for nuclear projects to be taken forward in Scotland to deliver cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy.
<02> We will support Scotland’s fishing and farming industries. We have extended the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme until 2029, introduced a new UK-wide Food Security Index and will increase the UK-wide farming budget by £1 billion over the next Parliament, ensuring the ringfenced amount provided to the Scottish Government rises by inflation each year. We will use powers in the Scotland Act
<02> to require the Scottish Government to provide annual reports on how this funding is being utilised and work with them to put a UK-wide food security target into law.
<02> We will establish a UK Farming Innovation Fund to deliver grants for innovative agricultural projects directly to farmers in Scotland, promoting economic development
<02> in rural areas. Only the Conservatives and Unionists will support Scotland’s fishing communities, with a further £100 million for the UK Seafood Fund to support small businesses and inshore fleets and a steadfast commitment to taking back control of our waters, negotiating the best quotas possible and remaining out of the hated Common Fisheries Policy.
<02> We will improve connectivity across Scotland with support for road and rail improvements and ferry services, including guaranteed investment to improve pinch points on the
<02> A75, providing £5 million for the evaluation of proposals to extend the current Borders Railway from Tweedbank through Hawick and on to Carlisle, updating the East Coast Main Line timetable to provide faster rail journeys between Edinburgh and London and providing funding for the UK Islands Forum Connectivity Project.
<02> Wales
<02> The Labour Welsh Government have let standards slide across crucial public services while focusing on policies people in Wales do not want, from putting more politicians in the Senedd to implementing a blanket 20mph speed limit across Wales and banning new roadbuilding.
<02> By contrast, the Conservatives and Unionists are delivering for Wales by cutting taxes again for 1.2 million working people in Wales and making investments in industry, local communities and infrastructure.
<02> And we want to go further.
<02> To improve connectivity across Wales,
<02> we’ll provide match funding to the Welsh Government to reconsider the M4 relief road and third Menai crossing options as well as wider improvements to the A55 and the A483 around Wrexham. We will provide funding to Monmouthshire Council to develop plans for a Chepstow bypass and prioritise the Pant- Llanymynech bypass.
<02> As a result of our decision to cancel the second phase of HS2 and invest the savings into local transport projects, we can commit £1 billion
<02> for the electrification of the North Wales Main Line and ensure Wales starts receiving Barnett consequentials for the projects funded from HS2 savings in England. We will fund rail upgrades at Padeswood to unlock the potential for wider improvements on the Borderlands Line and facilitate the electrification of the North Wales Main Line. We will prioritise development of the Pencoed level crossing and progressing work on the South Wales Main Line, to deliver new stations and services.
<02> We will expand our Backing Drivers’ Bill to cover Wales, reversing Labour’s blanket 20mph speed limit by requiring local consent for 20mph zones and giving local communities the legal right to challenge existing zones.
<02> To support Wales’ key sectors and industrial heritage, Welsh farmers will benefit from a £1 billion increase to the UK-wide farming budget, ensuring the ringfenced amount directed to Welsh farmers increases by inflation throughout the next Parliament, as well as grants for innovative agricultural projects from the £20 million UK Farming Innovation Fund and the extension of the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Scheme.
<02> We will also build on our new UK-wide food security index by putting a UK-wide food security target into law, adopt a consistent approach to biosecurity across Great Britain and require the Welsh Government to provide annual reports on how ringfenced agricultural funding from the UK Government is spent.
<02> The £500 million we are investing to secure
<02> a sustainable future for steelmaking in Port Talbot is bolstered by the £80 million the UK Government is providing to support the area to transition. We remain committed to delivering the electric arc furnace and supporting Port Talbot to thrive, including through the new Celtic Freeport. Floating offshore wind is at the heart of these plans and we will continue to support its development in the Celtic Sea. We will deliver the UK’s third mega-nuclear power station at Wylfa and support Wales’ potential to host small modular reactors.
<02> To strengthen Wales’ public services, we will put an additional neighbourhood police officer in every community across Wales, restore trust in policing and introduce tougher sentencing to make Wales safer.
<02> Improving the comparability of data across
<02> the UK will ensure the current Labour Welsh Government are held to account for their performance running Wales’ schools and hospitals. We will assess options to promote choice in NHS services across the UK, whether provided by the NHS or independent sector, and improve interoperability between the
<02> NHS in different parts of the UK, cross-border healthcare processes and joint working to tackle waiting lists.
<02> We will continue working with the Welsh Government on the expansion of Levelling
<02> Up Partnerships to Wales and support the Welsh language, including by backing Welsh broadcasting and the equitable provision of UK Government services in Welsh.
<02> We will bring forward legislation to reapply the entirety of the Trade Union Act 2016 to Wales. And a Welsh Conservative Government would reverse Labour’s plans to expand the Senedd, redirecting the cost towards people’s real priorities.
<02> Northern Ireland
<02> As Conservatives and Unionists, we continue to hugely value Northern Ireland’s contribution to our Union. For us, the best future for Northern Ireland will always be as part of a strong, prosperous and dynamic United Kingdom. We will never be neutral in expressing our support for it.
<02> At the same time, we respect those who seek
<02> a different constitutional outcome pursued by exclusively peaceful and democratic means. We will always govern in the interests of the whole community in Northern Ireland. Our aim is to build a Northern Ireland where politics works, the economy grows and society is stronger and more united.
<02> Our commitment to the 1998 Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its parts remains unwavering. Fundamental to the Agreement is the consent principle – that there can be no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the support of a majority of those who live there. Conservatives will always uphold the democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.
<02> ❱ We are committed to supporting Northern Ireland’s communities and economy to thrive. At the last Spending Review, we provided the Northern Ireland Executive with a record £15 billion a year through the block grant. To underpin the restoration
<02> of devolution, we provided the incoming Executive with a £3.3 billion spending package and subsequently agreed an interim fiscal framework in May 2024. We are also delivering over £1 billion of levelling up funding, including £150 million to develop
<02> an Enhanced Investment Zone. We hosted
<02> an Investment Summit in Northern Ireland last year, showcasing its innovation and technological strengths. And cutting National Insurance again will benefit 800,000 working people in Northern Ireland.
<02> ❱ The Windsor Framework and our Safeguarding the Union Command Paper have addressed the fundamental problems with the old Northern Ireland Protocol and provide Northern Ireland with unique advantages, including guaranteed unfettered access to the UK internal market and privileged access to the EU Single Market
<02> for goods.
<02> ❱ Through our UK internal market system, we have ensured that goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland that
<02> will only ever stay in the United Kingdom
<02> are subject to no checks, save for those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks. In addition, through the Stormont Brake we have addressed the democratic deficit in the old Protocol. A Conservative Government will faithfully implement all its commitments in the Windsor Framework and the Command Paper, including those measures to strengthen Northern Ireland’s place in the Union.
<02> ❱ Through the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023
<02> we have established the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery with £250 million
<02> of funding to ensure victims and survivors can recover more information about what happened to their loved ones than has been available through established mechanisms. We will continue to implement this legacy legislation and support the Commission with the aim of providing more answers to those that want them and helping society to move forward.
<02> ❱ While the security situation has been transformed for most people in Northern Ireland over the past three decades, there remains a very real threat from dissident republicans who retain both a capability and intent to cause harm. We will always give our fullest possible support to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other agencies for the vital work they do to keep people safe and secure. We will continue our efforts to end all forms of paramilitary activity for good.
<02> pensions
<02> Protecting pensioners’ income with the Triple Lock Plus.
<02> After a lifetime of work, people deserve dignity and security in their retirement.
<02> That’s why the Conservatives introduced the pensions Triple Lock in 2010 — guaranteeing that pensions rise every year, no matter what.
<02> Since it was introduced, the Triple Lock has meant pensioners have received an extra £3,700.
<02> But in a world becoming more uncertain. Rishi Sunak wants to go even further to give people confidence and security in retirement.
<02> So if you vote to stick with the plan, Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will not only guarantee the Triple Lock — we’ll introduce the Triple Lock Plus.
<02> This means the personal allowance for pensioners will rise every year — ensuring they NEVER pay tax on their state pension.

<02> THE TRIPLE LOCK PLUS: ONLY THE CONSERVATIVES HAVE A CLEAR PLAN FOR PENSIONERS
<02> From next April, the Conservatives will increase the personal allowance for pensioners in line with the Triple Lock by introducing a new age-related allowance—a tax cut of around £100 for 8 million pensioners.
<02> The Conservative Government have cut tax for working people by reducing National Insurance from 12 percent to 8 percent. Now they will cut tax for pensioners too.
<02> From next April, the Conservatives will increase the personal allowance for pensioners in line with the Triple Lock by introducing a new age-related allowance—a tax cut of around £100 for 8 million pensioners.
<02> They will guarantee in legislation that the pensioners’ personal allowance will rise in line with the highest of earnings, prices, or 2.5 percent so it is higher than the state pension in each year of the next Parliament: the new Triple Lock Plus.
<02> This is delivering on a core Conservative value that those who have worked hard during their lives should have dignity and security in retirement. Labour will hit pensioners with a Retirement Tax by dragging the State Pension into income tax for the first time, raiding pensioners just like the last Labour government.
<02> After committing to protect the Triple Lock earlier this year, the Conservatives will go further to boost pensioners’ incomes if they win the next election. In addition to uprating the State Pension in line with the highest of prices, earnings, or 2.5 percent, the tax-free personal allowance for pensioners will also rise by the Triple Lock—guaranteeing that the State Pension is always below the tax-free threshold. This means that pensioners will never pay income tax on their State Pension, as the Conservatives continue to deliver on their clear plan to provide dignity and security in retirement.
<02> As a result of the Triple Lock Plus, the average pensioner will see an increase in the State Pension of £428 next year alongside an income tax cut of £95. By the end of the Parliament, this will be a boost of £1,677 a year to their pension and a further £275 a year tax cut.
<02> The Triple Lock Plus builds on the Conservative Government’s strong track record of protecting people who worked hard all their lives after their retirement. The Conservatives first introduced the Triple Lock in 2011, which has seen the State Pension increase by more than £3,700 since they entered office—£990 more than if it had been uprated by prices, and £1,000 more than if it had been uprated by earnings since 2010.
<02> Meanwhile, Labour have refused to back the Triple Lock Plus and would oversee the State Pension being dragged into income tax for the first time in history if they entered government.
<02> Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan to support pensioners and will take the bold action needed to deliver financial security and dignity in retirement. Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour would tax pensioners more, taking them back to square one.
<02> RISHI SUNAK ANNOUNCES NATIONAL SERVICE POLICY
<02> Only the Conservatives will take the bold action needed to give young people the opportunities they deserve
<02> The UK has so much to be proud of as a country, but we also need to be open about the long-term challenges we face – including how generations of young people don’t have the opportunities they deserve.
<02> That is why the Conservatives will introduce a bold new model of National Service for 18-year-olds to be spent either in a competitive, full-time military placement over 12 months, or spend the equivalent of one weekend a month (25 days a year) volunteering for the community. This will give young people real world skills, while contributing to their country and community.
<02> The Conservatives’ plan will ensure the youngest generations, and the country as a whole, meet the challenges of an uncertain world. Sir Keir Starmer and Labour don’t have a clear plan and won’t take the bold action needed to navigate to a more secure future.
<02> By introducing a bold new model of mandatory National Service, every 18-year-old will either spend a full year in a competitive, full-time military placement or UK cyber defence, or spend the equivalent of one weekend a month (25 days a year) volunteering in a civic role. Individuals will be able to choose between roles in our communities, including in local infrastructure, the NHS, and the RNLI.
<02> This will give young people across the country the opportunities they deserve to gain the valuable life skills they need, making our country more secure and building a stronger national culture.
<02> This will be funded through the Conservatives’ clear plan to raise an additional £6 billion a year by the end of the next Parliament from cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion, of which £1 billion will be allocated to the National Service, in addition to the remaining £1.5 billion previously used for the UK Shared Prosperity Fund.
<02> This is on top of the Conservatives’ bold action to increase defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2030, the biggest strengthening of our national defence in a generation, maintaining our leading position in NATO and supporting our Armed Forces.
<02> Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour have no clear plan to strengthen our defence or support our young people and won’t take the bold action needed to navigate to a more secure future. Labour do not support increasing defence to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2030, putting a £75 billion investment in the UK’s defence at risk, and they would slash the number of apprenticeships across the country in half—putting our national security and the future of our young people at risk.
<02> Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan to support the youngest generations and will take the bold action needed to deliver the opportunities they rightfully deserve in a more uncertain world.

<02> Read Rishi Sunak's speech in full as the Prime Minister announces a General Election in July
<02> “In the last five years our country has fought through the most challenging times since the Second World War.
<02> “As I stand here as your Prime Minister, I can’t help but reflect that my first proper introduction to you was just over four years ago. I stood behind one of the podiums upstairs in the building behind me.
<02> “I told you that we faced a generation-defining moment and that we as a society could not be judged by some Government action, but by the small acts of kindness we showed one another.
<02> “You met that challenge and then some, and I had never been prouder to be British.
<02> “And when I introduced the furlough scheme, I did so not because I just saw a country in desperate need of help, all be it we were, but because I saw a country whose future hung in the balance.
<02> “I could be bold and trust in the tens of millions of you at home that you would rise to the moment, or I could accept the inevitable millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. In truth it was no choice at all.
<02> “I have never and will never leave the people of this country to face the darkest of days alone, and you know that because you’ve seen it.
<02> “As I did then I will forever do everything in my power to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. That is my promise to you. Because for so many of us, it’s easy to forget the scale of what we’ve been through.
<02> “We were hit by a pandemic that upended normal life. Who would have thought that the government would tell us how many times a day we could leave our homes, then just as we were recovering from Covid, war returned to Europe with Putin’s invasion of Ukraine sending your energy bills spiralling.
<02> “I came to office, above all, to restore economic stability. Economic stability is the bedrock of any future success whether that is rising wages or good jobs, investment in our public services, or the defence of the country.
<02> “And because of our collective sacrifice and hard work we have reached two major milestones in delivering that stability, showing that when we work together anything is possible.
<02> “Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted, outpacing Germany, France and the US. And this morning it was confirmed that inflation is back to normal, this means that the pressure on prices will ease and mortgage rates will come down. This is proof that the plan and priorities I set out are working.
<02> “I recognise that it has not always been easy. Some of you will just be starting to fill the benefits and for some it might still be hard when you look at your bank balance.
<02> “But this hard-earned economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning, the question now is how and who do you trust to turn that foundation into a secure future for you, your family, and our country?
<02> “Now is the moment for Britain to choose its future, to decide whether we want to build on the progress we have made or risk going back to square one with no plan and no certainty.
<02> “Earlier today I spoke with His Majesty the King to request the dissolution of Parliament. The King has granted this request and we will have a general election on July 4.
<02> “This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the Cold War. Putins’s Russia is waging a brutal war on Ukraine and will not stop there if he succeeds.
<02> “That war has also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security in the Middle East the forces of Islamist extremism threaten regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who attempt to undermine our values and divide or society here at home.
<02> “China is looking to dominate the 21st Century by stealing a lead in technology and migration is being weaponised by hostile estates to threaten the integrity of our borders. These uncertain times call for a clear plan and bold action to charter a course to a secure future.
<02> “You must choose in this election, who has that plan, who is prepared to take bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children?
<02> “Now, I cannot and will not claim that we have got everything right. No government should, but I am proud of what we have achieved together, the bold actions we have taken and I’m confident about what we can do in the future.
<02> “We tackled inflaton, controlled debt, cut workers’ taxes and increased the state pension by £900. We have reduced taxes in investment and seized the opportunities from Brexit to make this the best country in the world to grow for business, put record amounts of funding into our NHS and ensured it is now training the doctors and nurses it needs in the decades to come.
<02> “We prioritise energy security and your family finances over environmental dogma in our approach to net zero. We fully funded an increase in defence spending to two and a half per cent of GDP.
<02> “We made a decision to invest more in local transport that you actually use rather than endlessly power more money into HS2.
<02> “We set out a comprehensive plan to reform our welfare system to make it fair for those who pay for it, as well as those who need it. Immigration is finally coming down and we are stopping the boats with our Rwanda partnership.
<02> “And we ensure that the next generation grows smoke-free.
<02> “I hope that my work since I became Prime Minister shows that we have a plan and are prepared to take bold action necessary for our country to flourish.
<02> “Now, I have stuck with that plan and always been honest with you about what is needed, even when that’s been difficult, because I’m guided by doing what is right for our country, not what is easy.
<02> “I can’t say the same thing for the Labour Party, because I don’t know what they offer and, in truth, I don’t think you know either.
<02> “And that’s because they have no plan, there is no bold action, and as a result the future can only be uncertain with them.
<02> “On July 5, either Keir Starmer or I will be prime minister.
<02> “He has shown time and time again that he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power.
<02> “I have to say, if he was happy to abandon all the promises he made to become Labour leader once he got the job, how can you know that he won’t do exactly the same thing if he were to become prime minister?
<02> “If you don’t have the conviction to stick to anything you say, if you don’t have the courage to tell people what you want to do, and if you don’t have a plan, how can you possibly be trusted to lead our country, especially at this most uncertain of times?
<02> “Over the next few weeks I will fight for every vote, I will earn your trust and I will prove to you that only a Conservative government led by me will not put our hard-earned economic stability and restore pride and confidence in our country, and with a clear plan and bold action, will deliver a secure future for you, your family and our United Kingdom.
<02> WHY I'M CALLING A GENERAL ELECTION
<02> May 26, 2024
<02> Rishi Sunak explains in the Spectator why he has called a General Election.
<02> This article first appeared in The Spectator on 22 May 2024.
<02> In the last five years, our country has fought through the most challenging times since the second world war. As I stand here as your Prime Minister, I can’t help but reflect that my first proper introduction to you was just over four years ago. I stood behind one of the podiums upstairs in the building behind me. I told you that we faced a generation defining moment and that we as a society, could not be judged by some government action, but by the small acts of kindness that we showed one another. You met that challenge and then some, and I have never been prouder to be British.
<02> And when I introduced the furlough scheme, I did so not because I saw a country simply in need of desperate help, albeit we were, but because I saw a country whose future hung in the balance. I could be bold and trust in the tens of millions of you at home that you would rise to the moment. Or I could accept the inevitable millions of job losses and pick up the pieces. In truth, it was no choice at all. I have never, and will never, leave the people of this country to face the darkest of days alone.
<02> And you know that because you’ve seen it as I did, that I will forever do everything in my power to provide you with the strongest possible protection I can. That is my promise to you. Because for so many of us, it’s easy to forget the scale of what we’ve been through.
<02> We were hit by a pandemic that upended normal life. Who would have thought that the government would ever tell us how many times a day we could leave our homes? Then, just as we were recovering from Covid, war returned to Europe with Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, sending your energy bills spiralling. I came to office above all, to restore economic stability.
<02> Economic stability is the bedrock of any future success, whether that is rising wages and good jobs, investment in our public services, or the defence of the country. And because of our collective sacrifice and your hard work, we have reached two major milestones in delivering that stability, showing that when we work together, anything is possible.
<02> Our economy is now growing faster than anyone predicted, outpacing Germany, France and the United States. And this morning it was confirmed that inflation is back to normal. This means that the pressure on prices will ease and mortgage rates will come down. This is proof that the plan and priorities I set out are working. I recognise that it has not always been easy. Some of you will only just be starting to feel the benefits and for some it might still be hard when you look at your bank balance. For this hard earned economic stability was only ever meant to be the beginning. The question now is how and who do you trust to turn that foundation into a secure future for you, your family, and our country?
<02> Now is the moment for Britain to choose its future. To decide whether we want to build on the progress we have made, or risk going back to square one with no plan and no certainty. Earlier today, I spoke with His Majesty the King to request the dissolution of parliament. The King has granted this request and we will have a general election on the 4th of July. This election will take place at a time when the world is more dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold war.
<02> Putin’s Russia is waging a brutal war in Ukraine and will not stop there if he succeeds. That war has also made it all too clear the risk to our energy security. In the Middle East, the forces of Islamist extremism threaten regional and ultimately global stability. These tensions are exploited by extremists who seek to undermine our values and divide our society here at home. China is looking to dominate the 21st century by stealing the lead in technology, and migration is being weaponised by hostile states to threaten the integrity of our borders.
<02> These uncertain times call for a clear plan and bold action to chart a course to a secure future. You must choose in this election: who has that plan? Who is prepared to take the bold action necessary to secure a better future for our country and our children? Now, I cannot and will not claim that we have got everything right. No government should. But I am proud of what we have achieved together: the bold actions we have taken, and I’m confident about what we can do in the future.
<02> We’ve tackled inflation, controlled debt, cut workers taxes and increased the state pension by £900. We’ve reduced taxes on investment and seized the opportunities of Brexit to make this the best country in the world to grow a business; record amounts of funding into our NHS and ensured it is now training the doctors and nurses it needs in the decades to come.
<02> We reformed education and our children are now the best readers in the western world. We prioritised energy security, and your family finances over environmental dogma in our approach to net zero.
<02> We fully funded an increase in defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. We made a decision to invest more in local transport that you actually use, rather than endlessly plow more money into HS2.
<02> We set out a comprehensive plan to reform our welfare system, to make it fair for those who pay for it, as well as those who need it. Immigration is finally coming down and we are stopping the boats with our Rwanda partnership. And we will ensure that the next generation grows up smoke-free.
<02> I hope that my work since I became Prime Minister shows that we have a plan and are prepared to take bold action necessary for our country to flourish.
<02> Now, I’ve stuck with that plan and have always been honest with you about what is needed, even when that’s been difficult, because I’m guided by doing what is right for our country, not what is easy. I can’t say the same thing for the Labour party because I don’t know what they offer. And in truth, I don’t think you know either. And that’s because they have no plan. There is no bold action, and as a result, the future can only be uncertain with them on the 5th of July.
<02> Either Keir Starmer or I will be Prime Minister. He has shown time and time again that he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power. If he was happy to abandon all the promises he made to become Labour leader once he got the job, how can you know that he won’t do exactly the same thing if he were to become Prime Minister? If you don’t have the conviction to stick to anything you say. If you don’t have the courage to tell people what you want to do. And if you don’t have a plan. How can you possibly be trusted to lead our country, especially at this most uncertain of times?
<02> Over the next few weeks, I will fight for every vote. I will earn your trust, and I will prove to you that only a Conservative government led by me, will not put our hard earned economic stability at risk, and restore pride and confidence in our country, and with a clear plan and bold action, will deliver a secure future for you, your family and our United Kingdom.
