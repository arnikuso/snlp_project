<01> High-quality early education and childcare is a crucial opportunity to transform life chances. Too often it is unavailable, or unaffordable.
<01> As an initial step, Labour will open an additional 3,000 nurseries through upgrading space in primary schools, to deliver the extension of government funded hours families are entitled to.
<01> Supporting children in the early part of their life also means giving parents the flexibility they need to care for their children. Labour will review the parental leave system, so it best supports working families, within our first year in government.
<01> Every child should have a loving, secure home. Labour will work with local government to support children in care, including through kinship, foster care, and adoption, as well as strengthening regulation of the children’s social care sector.
<01> Sadly, too often we see families falling through the cracks of public services. Labour will improve data sharing across services, with a single unique identifier, to better support children and families.
<01> Raising school standards
<01> Labour is determined to raise school standards for every child, and ensure they are prepared for the future. Most children attend schools where the Conservatives are failing to provide the support and teaching that they need. Labour will end the VAT exemption and business rates relief for private schools to invest in our state schools.
<01> The factor that makes the biggest difference to a child’s education is high-quality teaching; but there are shortages of qualified teachers across the country. Labour will recruit an additional 6,500 new expert teachers. We will get more teachers into shortage subjects, support areas that face recruitment challenges, and tackle retention issues. The way bursaries are allocated, and the structure of retention payments, will be reviewed.
<01> Teaching is a hard-earned and hard-learned skill, Labour will work to further raise its status. We will update the Early Career Framework, maintaining its grounding in evidence, and ensure any new teacher entering the classroom has, or is working towards, Qualified Teacher Status. We will introduce a new Teacher Training Entitlement to ensure teachers stay up to date on best practice with continuing professional development.
<01> School support staff play a vital role in children’s education and development. Labour will reinstate the School Support Staff Negotiating Body, which will help address the acute recruitment and retention crisis in support roles.
<01> Raising school standards starts with early education. The last Labour government’s promotion of phonics put rocket boosters under the reading and writing ability of a generation of children. We will do the same for numeracy, improving the quality of maths teaching across nurseries and primary schools.
<01> Developing early communication skills is another key foundation for life, with serious knock-on consequences when development is delayed. Labour will fund evidence-based early-language interventions in primary schools, so that every child can find their voice.
<01> Alongside high-quality teaching, driving up standards in education requires outstanding leadership. Labour will create a new Excellence in Leadership Programme, a mentoring framework that expands the capacity of headteachers and leaders to improve their schools. Labour will introduce new Regional Improvement Teams, to enhance school-to-school support, and spread best practice.
<01> Accountability is non-negotiable, which is why Labour supports school inspection. Under the Conservatives our inspection regime has been broken. A system which declares nine in ten schools are good or outstanding fails to provide sufficient information on school performance. We will enhance the inspection regime by replacing a single headline grade with a new report card system telling parents clearly how schools are performing. We will also bring Multi-Academy Trusts into the inspection system and introduce a new annual review of safeguarding, attendance, and off-rolling.
<01> Every child should have a broad curriculum with an excellent foundation in reading, writing and maths, and support to develop essential digital, speaking, and creative skills. Yet today, too many are missing out. Labour will launch an expert-led review of curriculum and assessment, working with school staff, parents and employers to change this.
<01> Our reforms will build on the hard work of teachers who have brought their subjects alive with knowledge-rich syllabuses, to deliver a curriculum which is rich and broad, inclusive, and innovative. To capture this breadth, our review will consider the right balance of assessment methods whilst protecting the important role of examinations.
<01> Too often our education and care systems do not meet the needs of all children, including those with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). Labour will take a community-wide approach, improving inclusivity and expertise in mainstream schools, as well as ensuring special schools cater to those with the most complex needs. We will make sure admissions decisions account for the needs of communities and require all schools to co-operate with their local authority on school admissions, SEND inclusion, and place planning.
<01> Too many children’s life chances are being scarred by rising poverty. Too many arrive at school not ready to learn, and too many are absent. Breakfast clubs improve behaviour, attendance, and learning. Labour will fund free breakfast clubs in every primary school, accessible to all children. Our breakfast clubs will support parents through the cost-of-living crisis. We will also bring down the cost of school by limiting the number of branded items of uniform and PE kit that schools can require.
<01> Poor mental health is another barrier to learning. The struggle to access support is paralysing children and young people through their formative years. Labour will provide access to specialist mental health professionals in every school, so every young person has access to early support to address problems before they escalate. This will complement our plan for Young Futures Hubs, which will make sure every community has an open-access hub for children and young people with drop-in mental health support.
<01> Reforming further and higher education
<01> After years of Conservative chaos and policy churn, the skills system in England is confusing for young people, adults, and employers. Apprenticeship numbers have plummeted. Skills shortages are widespread. Young people have been left without the opportunities they need. The result is an economy without the necessary skills, nor any plan for the skills needs of the future. Labour will address this by bringing forward a comprehensive strategy for post‐16 education. And we will guarantee training, an apprenticeship, or help to find work for all 18- to 21-year-olds.
<01> We will establish Skills England to bring together business, training providers and unions with national and local government to ensure we have the highly trained workforce needed to deliver Labour’s Industrial Strategy. Skills England will formally work with the Migration Advisory Committee to make sure training in England accounts for the overall needs of the labour market. And we are committed to devolving adult skills funding to Combined Authorities, empowering local leaders to have greater control of skills development in their areas, alongside a greater role in supporting people into work. Skills England will co-ordinate between local areas to ensure everyone can access all the opportunities available.
<01> Labour will transform Further Education colleges into specialist Technical Excellence Colleges. These colleges will work with businesses, trade unions, and local government to provide young people with better job opportunities and the highly trained workforce that local economies need.
<01> Labour will also reform the Conservatives’ broken Apprenticeships Levy. The current rigid rules ignore vital skills and training needed to access apprenticeships. Labour will create a flexible Growth and Skills Levy, with Skills England consulting on eligible courses to ensure qualifications offer value for money.
<01> Labour will continue to support the aspiration of every person who meets the requirements and wants to go to university.
<01> We recognise that UK higher education creates opportunity, is a world-leading sector in our economy, and supports local communities. To better integrate further and higher education, and ensure high-quality teaching, Labour’s post-16 skills strategy will set out the role for different providers, and how students can move between institutions, as well as strengthening regulation. We will act to improve access to universities and raise teaching standards.
<01> The current higher education funding settlement does not work for the taxpayer, universities, staff, or students. Labour will act to create a secure future for higher education and the opportunities it creates across the UK. We will work with universities to deliver for students and our economy.
<01> Access to arts, music and sport
<01> With Labour, the arts and music will no longer be the preserve of a privileged few. Culture is an essential part of supporting children and young people to develop creativity and find their voice. There is huge potential for growth in the creative industries that benefit every corner of the UK.
<01> Labour will implement our creative industries sector plan as part of our Industrial Strategy, creating good jobs and accelerating growth in film, music, gaming, and other creative sectors. We will work constructively with the BBC and our other public service broadcasters so they continue to inform, educate and entertain people, and support the creative economy by commissioning distinctively British content.
<01> Labour will support children to study a creative or vocational subject until they are 16, and ensure accountability measures reflect this. We will get more children active by protecting time for physical education, and supporting the role grassroots clubs play in expanding access to sport.
<01> Labour will improve access to cultural assets by requiring publicly funded national museums and galleries to increase the loans they make from their collections to communities across the country. We will also launch a new National Music Education Network – a one-stop shop with information on courses and classes for parents, teachers and children. Access to music, drama and sport has become difficult and expensive because of ticket touting. Labour will put fans back at the heart of events by introducing new consumer protections on ticket resales.
<01> From the Men’s UEFA European Football Championship to the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup to the Invictus Games, Labour will deliver international events with pride and seek new opportunities where we can, creating a legacy to inspire the next generation of talent while promoting exercise and healthy living.
<01> Labour is committed to making Britain the best place in the world to be a football fan. We will reform football governance to protect football clubs across our communities and to give fans a greater say in the way they are run. We will introduce a Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator to ensure financial sustainability of football clubs in England. We will never allow a closed league of select clubs to be siphoned off from the English football pyramid.
<01> “I welcome Labour’s proposals set out by Keir Starmer to broaden opportunity and make sure all young people have access to the arts. Opening up access to creativity in our schools is critical, not just so that our children have a better chance at a career in the arts, but because access is what will fuel growth in the creative industries — one of the most important sectors for the future of the economy — creating good jobs in all corners of the country.”

<01> Respect and equality for all
<01> Everyone in this country deserves a government that matches their ambition. Labour will ensure no matter whatever your background, you can thrive, and therefore we will enact the socio-economic duty in the Equality Act 2010.
<01> Women’s equality will be at the heart of our missions. Our plan to Make Work Pay will transform the lives of working women, including by strengthening rights to equal pay and protections from maternity and menopause discrimination and sexual harassment. And Labour will take action to reduce the gender pay gap, building on the legacy of Barbara Castle’s Equal Pay Act.
<01> Labour will introduce a landmark Race Equality Act, to enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority people, strengthen protections against dual discrimination and root out other racial inequalities. Labour will also reverse the Conservatives’ decision to downgrade the monitoring of antisemitic and Islamophobic hate.
<01> Labour is committed to championing the rights of disabled people and to the principle of working with them, so that their views and voices will be at the heart of all we do. We will introduce the full right to equal pay for disabled people. Building on gender pay gap reporting, we will introduce disability and ethnicity pay gap reporting for large employers. We will support disabled people to work by improving employment support and access to reasonable adjustments. We will also tackle the Access to Work backlog and make sure people can try out a job without fear of an immediate benefit reassessment if it does not work out.
<01> Delivering opportunities for all means that everyone should be treated with respect and dignity. Labour will protect LGBT+ and disabled people by making all existing strands of hate crime an aggravated offence.
<01> So-called conversion therapy is abuse – there is no other word for it – so Labour will finally deliver a full trans-inclusive ban on conversion practices, while protecting the freedom for people to explore their sexual orientation and gender identity.
<01> We will also modernise, simplify, and reform the intrusive and outdated gender recognition law to a new process. We will remove indignities for trans people who deserve recognition and acceptance; whilst retaining the need for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a specialist doctor, enabling access to the healthcare pathway.
<01> Labour is proud of our Equality Act and the rights and protections it affords women; we will continue to support the implementation of its single-sex exceptions.
<01> Labour will stop the chaos, end the failure and division of the last 14 years, and turn the page to ensure everyone can thrive.
<01> Help deliver change to Britain.
<01> Build an NHS fit for the future

<02> Helping young people get the skills and opportunities they deserve
<02> The world is growing more uncertain. The workplace is changing, the skills required are different, and young people face new challenges.
<02> So our job is to make sure all young people can thrive, no matter what the world looks like.
<02> If you vote to stick with our clear plan, we’ll end rip-off degrees, deliver 100,000 more apprenticeships and introduce a bold new model of National Service.
<02> Ending rip-off degrees to invest in apprenticeships
<02> We’ll change the law so we can close the worst-performing university courses.
<02> This will free up cash to fund 100,000 new apprenticeships for young people – building on our apprenticeship drive since 2010, which has given over 5.8 million people the opportunities they deserve.
<02> A bold new model of National Service
<02> Under our clear plan, 18-year-olds will have a choice:
<02> One weekend a month volunteering in their community, supporting the NHS, British Red Cross, RNLI or other community groups
<02> OR
<02> A full-time military placement for twelve months, learning new skills like logistics, cyber security and civil response operations
<02> This means young people will be able to pick up new skills and get on in life. And we’ll foster a sense of duty and civic pride, helping to protect our country’s shared values.
<02> You can make this happen. Vote Conservative on Thursday 4 July.
<02> security
<02> Making Britain secure in an uncertain world
<02> The world is growing more uncertain. From the impact of the pandemic to war in Europe and the Middle East, you and your family deserve to know your future will be secure.
<02> So that means we need a government with a clear plan to defend our priorities, protect our country and deliver the bold action that’s required.
<02> That’s why we’re investing more in the people who keep us all safe.
<02> If you vote to stick with the plan, Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2030.
<02> This means our military will be able to meet the threats of a challenging world and protect you and your family.
<02> You can make this happen. Vote Conservative on Thursday 4 July.
<02> From the impact of the pandemic to war in Ukraine and the Middle East, Britain faces huge challenges.
<02> The world is more uncertain than ever. So you and your family deserve a government with a clear plan for a secure future. And only the Conservatives will take the bold action to deliver it.
<02> From introducing furlough to helping with energy bills, Rishi Sunak has proven he’ll take bold action to deliver a secure future.
<02> When the pandemic hit, Rishi Sunak introduced the furlough scheme. This meant that 14 million people across the UK could keep their jobs, protect their family finances and get through the pandemic.
<02> Rishi Sunak’s track record proves that he’ll do whatever it takes to support British families, even if it’s difficult or unpopular.
<02> When Putin launched his illegal war in Ukraine, prices around the world shot up. This sent energy bills spiralling and ground our economy to a halt.
<02> So when Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister, he promised to restore economic stability.
<02> That’s why he set out a clear plan to halve inflation, grow the economy and reduce debt. And he stuck to it.
<02> Inflation is now down from 11.1% to 2.3% now. Our economy is growing faster than any other G7 country. And the independent Office for Budget Responsibility has confirmed that debt is on track to fall.
<02> So Rishi Sunak’s clear plan to deliver a secure future is working. And that’s why we can afford to take bold action to help families even more with the cost of living…
<02> A clear plan.
<02> Find out how we’re taking bold action to guarantee a more secure future for you, your family, and our country.
<02> Now that our economy is back on track, we can afford to start cutting taxes.
<02> At the moment, hardworking people face two taxes on their pay: income tax AND National Insurance.
<02> This isn’t fair. And only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a plan to tackle this unfair double tax on work.
<02> So far, we’ve cut National Insurance by a third – from 12% to 8%. That’s a £900 tax-cut for someone on an average salary of £34,500.
<02> And Rishi Sunak has set out his bold long-term ambition to abolish National Insurance entirely. So we end the double tax on work and support hardworking families.
<02> Just as we’re cutting taxes for hardworking people, we’ll also cut taxes for pensioners.
<02> The Triple Lock Plus guarantees that not only pensions rise every year, but the tax-free personal allowance rises as well. That means the state pension will always be below the tax-free threshold.
<02> Providing dignity and security in retirement for everyone.
<02> At this general election, the country faces a choice.
<02> Clear plan, bold action, and a secure future with Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives.
<02> Or Keir Starmer’s Labour Party: no conviction, no courage, no plan.
<02> In a world growing more uncertain by the day, British families deserve a government with a clear plan, ready to take the bold action needed for a secure future.
<02> Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will deliver it.
<02> So on Thursday 4 July, vote Conservative.
